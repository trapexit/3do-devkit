#	File:			Weaver.make
#
#	Contains:		make rules to build the Weaver stream data merging tool
#
#	Note:			The Weaver is set up to be built with either THINK C or with
#					MPW. When built as an MPW tool, the file WeaverMain.c is not
#					used as it contains glue code to enable the input of command
#					line arguments when running under THINK C. The only purpose
#					for using THINK C is for its symbolic debugger. The released
#					version of the tool is always expected to be an MPW tool.

#	10/20/93	jb		Change to use standard subscriber includes 
#	6/17/93		jb		Add DEBUGOPTIONS for use with symbolic debugger
#	5/18/93		jb		New today.
