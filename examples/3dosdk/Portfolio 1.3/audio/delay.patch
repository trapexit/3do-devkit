; Shows usage of delay line commands and delay1tap.dsp.
;
; Try pressing and releasing the B button while adjusting the
; sawenvsvfenv.dsp's Frequency knob to make cool whale-like noises.


; --------------------- delay line
;
; inputs
;   delay Input - signal input to delay
;
; outputs
;   delay Output - signal output from delay
;
; knobs
;   delay OriginalMix  - output gain of dry input signal
;   delay Tap0Mix      - output gain of delayed signal
;   delay OriginalSend - send gain of dry input signal
;   delay Tap0Send     - send gain of delayed signal (feedback)

LoadInstrument  delay       delay1tap.dsp 0             ; delay line instrument
                                                        ; (not retriggable so delay continues after rest of patch is released)
DelayLine       delayline   44100                       ; single channel delay line 44100 bytes long (0.5 second)
AttachSample    delaysend   delay delayline OutFIFO     ; attach delay line to the output part of delay instrument
AttachSample    delayreturn delay delayline Tap0 50     ; attach delay line to the input part of delay instrument.

; Attachment offset is set so that the player attachment is
; just a little ahead of the writer (nearly as far away from the
; writer as possible).  This yields the maximum delay time
; for a given delay line.
;
; There is currently no way to adjust the delay time with a knob, which
; makes it rather tough to do things like flanging.  This is a limitation
; of the audiofolio.  We have some ideas about how to get around this
; problem though - stay tuned.
