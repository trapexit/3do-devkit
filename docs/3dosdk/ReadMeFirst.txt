This folder contains the online version of the complete and most recent Developer's Documentation Set.  This documentation is in HTML (HyperText Markup Language) format, and is viewable by any html "browser" such as NCSA Mosaic (copyrighted by the University of Illinois) and Netscape Navigator (TM) (copyrighted  by  Netscape Communications Corporation).

HOW TO GET AN HTML BROWSER

NCSA Mosaic and Netscape, as well as a number of other html browsers, are available from online sources as well as from commercial vendors.  You can also find browsers included in books covering the World Wide Web.   

Both NCSA Mosaic and the Netscape Navigator are available from the 3DO Infoserver at (415) 261-3405.  

HOW TO READ THE ONLINE DOCUMENTATION

Your first task is to install Mosaic or Netscape on your Macintosh.  You do NOT need an Internet connection to read these documents.  Once you have either Mosaic or Netscape installed, you can read the documentation directly off the CD.  You can also copy the DevDocs folder onto a server or to your Macintosh and read it from there.

Once you have opened your HTML browser, select Open Local from the File menu ( Mosaic) or Open File from the File menu (Netscape), then select the DevDocs folder.  Open the file Welcome.html.  This file is your starting point to the rest of the documentation set.  Click on the underlined hypertext links to navigate through the documentation.

For further details, refer to "Using the Online Documentation" in the 3DO Portfolio 2.5 Release Notes.
