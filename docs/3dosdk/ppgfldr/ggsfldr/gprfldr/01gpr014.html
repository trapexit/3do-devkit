<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>Err DeleteVDL (Item vdlItem)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
This macro is a convenience call to <CODE>DeleteItem()</CODE>. It deletes a VDL that was created with a call to <CODE>SubmitVDL()</CODE>. Any data structures and buffers allocated by <CODE>SubmitVDL()</CODE> are also deleted. <P>
After the call to this macro, the VDL item number becomes invalid. If the VDL is currently being used in a screen that's being displayed, the screen will go black. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>vdlItem
<DD>The item number of a VDL structure. 
</DL>
<H3>Return Value</H3>

<H3>Caveats</H3>
 <CODE>DeleteScreenGroup()</CODE> does not delete VDLs that were created with the initial <CODE>CreateScreenGroup()</CODE> if new VDLs have been attached to the screens with <CODE>SetVDL()</CODE>. If a new VDL has been attached to a screen in the ScreenGroup being deleted with the <CODE>DeleteScreenGroup()</CODE> call, then the new VDL is deleted as well. <P>
