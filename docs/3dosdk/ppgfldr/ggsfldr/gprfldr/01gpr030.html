<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>void FastMapCelInit (CCB *ccb)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
FastMapCelInit() initializes a CCB for use with MapCel. It requires that the ccb_Width and ccb_Height fields of the CCB are correct when the routine is called, and that the routine will replace the current values of the ccb_Width and ccb_Height fields. If the ccb_Width and ccb_Height of the cel are both powers of 2, then they are replaced by the log(base 2) of their respective values. If one or both fields are not a power of 2, the ccb_Width is replaced by (-0x10000/ccb_Width) and ccb_Height is replaced by (0x10000/ccb_Height). <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>

<H3>Caveats</H3>
The FastMapCel calls are not compatible with <CODE>MapCel()</CODE>, and cannot be called interchangeably. <P>
Since this call modifies the ccb_Width and ccb_Height fields of the CCB, it cannot be called multiple times for the same CCB. <P>
