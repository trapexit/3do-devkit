<A NAME="XREF24972"><H2>Problem with Gaps Between Cels</A></H2>
<B>Q:</B>  When I display two cels at a slant (two corners join at one 
point), there are some gaps between the cels through which the background 
is visible. <P>
<B>A:</B> When rendering two adjacent cels that theoretically share a 
common border, developers have noticed "stitching" effects-gaps and 
overlaps between the cels. The way that cel images are mapped to display 
memory causes this problem.<P>
The region fill algorithm that maps single pixels from cel source imagery 
to regions of pixels in the display buffer never leaves uncovered pixels 
between adjacent regions. The problem between adjacent cels only arises 
when at least one of the following is true: <P>
<UL>
<LI>The common border between the cels is covered by a different number of 
regions from the two cels; or 
<p>
<LI>The shared corner points of regions that are supposed to be adjacent 
do not have identical positions-which is really what is implied by cels 
having a different number of pixels on their shared border
</UL>
To guarantee that the edges between two cels close, make sure that both 
cels have the same number of pixels along their common border, and that 
the common corners have identical positions-a 1/65536-pixel difference in 
the fractional part of the position of a corner that is supposed to be 
common can cause undesired gaps or overlaps. <P>
Because of the way fractional values accumulate during the rendering 
process, not all combinations of corner positions and cel widths and 
heights are possible. If a cel has width <I>w</I>, height <I>h</I>, and 
origin (o_x, o_y), then its corners (counting clockwise around the source) 
must be constrained in the following way: <P>
<UL>
<LI>The differences between the x and y positions of the first destination 
corner and the origin point must be equal to 0 mod w (in units of 1/65536 
pixel position). 
<p>
<LI>The differences between the x and y positions of the second 
destination corner and the origin point must be equal to 0 mod (w*h) (in 
units of 1/65536-pixel position). 
<p>
<LI>The differences between the x and y positions of the second 
destination corner and the origin point must be equal to 0 mod h (in units 
of 1/65536-pixel position).
</UL>
If the width and height of a cel are both a power of 2 and their product 
does not exceed 65536, then any arrangement of the four corners where the 
fractional portions of the x positions and the fractional portions of the 
y positions are all equal is achievable. This is probably the easiest rule 
to follow, because it's easy to divide by powers of 2 when creating the 
deltas for the cel control blocks.<P>
The numbers don't necessarily have to be a power of 2, and the cels can 
have different heights and widths as long as cels are arranged so that 
common borders share the same number of pixels. For example, if all the 
cels a program uses are 37 x 53, any arrangement of the four corners where 
the positions are equal to each other mod 1961 (in units of 1/65536 pixel) 
is achievable.<P>
Unfortunately, the current <CODE>MapCel()</CODE> function takes a 
structure as input that describes the destination corners in units of 
whole pixels. <CODE>MapCel()</CODE> also performs explicit divisions in 
its calculations and does not take advantage of the performance 
improvements afforded by cel dimensions that are powers of 2. You can use 
the <CODE>MapP2Cel()</CODE> function in Lib3DO to quickly render cels 
whose width and height are integral powers of 2, or write your own 
function. <P>
<A NAME="XREF22819"><H2>Huge Cels Draw Slowly</A></H2>
<B>Q:</B> I have a 16-bit, 320-x-440 cel. I'd like to spin it, zoom it, 
and scroll it over the screen, but when I <CODE>use</CODE><CODE> 
DrawCel()</CODE> to display it, the screen update rate seems to be only 5 
to 10 frames per second. If a cel is less than one third the size of the 
screen, updates seem to occur at 30 frames a second. Do you think I'm 
doing something wrong?<P>
<B>A:</B> Nothing's really wrong; you're just trying to render a boatload 
of data. 320 * 400 * 16 bits/pixel == 256000 bytes that the cel engine 
must crunch through.<P>
You're writing to the whole screen (153 KB) and reading the whole cel 
(~256 KB). This takes many bus cycles.<P>
Here are some tips for improving rendering speed:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Always save your cels as packed. In some cases, this results in larger 
cels-make sure it doesn't. Cels with long horizontal runs of identical 
pixels pack well. You get the added benefit of declared transparency.
<p>
<LI>Consider a lower bit depth for cels. 16-bit uncoded cels are 
<I>very</I> wasteful and should only be used when all other options are 
unacceptable. 8-bit coded cels and 6-bit coded cels can yield striking 
results with a little care.
<p>
<LI>Use both corner engines. To enable the second corner engine, turn on 
the <CODE>CCB_ACE</CODE> bit in the<CODE> FLAGS </CODE>field. 
</UL>
The idea is to reduce the number of memory fetches the system must do to 
render the cel. The fewer fetches, the more bus cycles saved for write 
cycles. The cel engine is pretty clever about using as many cycles as it 
can.<P>
