The first component of the display generator is the background pixel detector, which reads the incoming 15-bit color value to see if it is set to zero (R=0, G=0, and B=0). If it is, the detector sets the background pixel flag so the incoming pixel is treated as a background pixel. This flag notifies the CLUT sets and SlipStream, the two components that can act on background pixels.<P>
