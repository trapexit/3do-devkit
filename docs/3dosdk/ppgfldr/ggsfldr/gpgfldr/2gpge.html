SlipStream is a second option for handling background pixels. When turned on by the VDLP, SlipStream substitutes a pixel from an external video source for each background pixel. It positions the frame buffer image as a foreground image above the second image, which becomes an underlying image. The underlying image shows through any background pixels in the frame buffer image.<P>
<B>Note: </B>SlipStream is only available in the cable set top terminal and is used for mixing Portfolio graphics with broadcast video.<P>
