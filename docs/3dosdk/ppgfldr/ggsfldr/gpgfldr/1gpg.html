This chapter introduces you to the 3DO graphics hardware and the processes that take place there. It also provides a review of NTSC display basics.<P>
The 3DO hardware is designed to get the best image possible from an NTSC display while providing useful animation and coloring tools. To do so, the hardware performs some complex operations. These operations are described in general terms in this chapter. If the details seem overwhelming, keep in mind that you don't need to know everything if you stick to simple graphics programming. At first, you might want to ignore the more difficult topics such as alternate multiplier values and P-modes. However, if you want to get translucent moving objects, high-resolution images, custom color palettes, and more, you need to become acquainted with everything in this chapter and the two chapters that follow before you go on to programming with the Graphics folio.<P>
