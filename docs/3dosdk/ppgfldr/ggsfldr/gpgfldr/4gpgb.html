Before a task can use any Graphics folio calls, it must first open the Graphics folio using:<P>
<CODE><DL>
<DD><CODE>Err OpenGraphicsFolio( void )</CODE><BR>
</DL>
</CODE>When executed, this call opens the Graphics folio. It returns a positive value if successful, or a negative value (an error code) if unsuccessful.<P>
If you don't open the Graphics folio before you make graphics calls, your task will die a hideous death the first time it makes a graphics call. If your task seems to be bombing for no good reason, check to make sure you've opened the Graphics folio.<P>
