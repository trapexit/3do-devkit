<A NAME="XREF13334"></A> Play a compressed4 bit Intel/DVI format sample at half rate.<P>
<H3>Function</H3>
This instrument plays a sample that has been previously compressed to a 4 bit Intel/DVI format.  Run the SoundHack program to compress a sound sample from 16 bits to 4 bits (Intel/DVI format).  This instrument uses the decodeadpcm.dsp library routine which must be loaded as an instrument prior to using this instrument.  This instrument plays a sample that was recorded at 22050 Hertz, playing it back at 44100 Hertz with interpolated values between samples to keep the sampled sound's original pitch and duration. <P>
