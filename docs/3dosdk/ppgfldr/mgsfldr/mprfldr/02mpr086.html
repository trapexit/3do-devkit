<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>int32 spService (SPPlayer *player, int32 signals)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
This function<P>
. processes signals received by the client's sent by the SPPlayer, and<P>
. reads and spools more sound data, processing marker actions along the way. <P>
This function synchronizes the SPPlayer's SoundSpooler to the state of the signals read from the last <CODE>WaitSignal()</CODE>. You must call it after waiting for SPPlayer's signals before calling any other sound player function for this SPPlayer (with the exception of <CODE>spDeletePlayer()</CODE>, which can tolerate the spooler being out of sync with the task's signals). <P>
This function can set or clear the SP_STATUS_F_BUFFER_ACTIVE flag, depending on buffer usage. It clears SP_STATUS_F_READING when there's no more sound data to read. This function may be called under any player state including when SP_STATUS_F_PLAYING is not set without any ill effects. <P>
This function must be called exactly once for each <CODE>WaitSignal()</CODE> on an SPPlayer's signals. It will almost certainly have dangerous results if fed incorrect signals (signals other than from the most recent <CODE>WaitSignal()</CODE>, or signals that it has already processed). <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>player
<DD>Pointer to SPPlayer to service. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>signals
<DD>Signals last received to process. Ignores any signals that do not belong to this SPPlayer. Does nothing if none of the SPPlayer's signals are set. 
</DL>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
Non-negative player status flags (SP_STATUS_F_) on success; negative error code on failure. <P>
<H3>Implementation</H3>
Library call implemented in music.lib V24. <P>
<H3>Examples</H3>
<CODE>
<PRE>
// error checking omitted for brevity

    const int32 playersigs = spGetPlayerSignalMask (player);
        // service player until it's done

        const int32 sigs = WaitSignal (playersigs |
                                       othersignals1 |
                                       othersignals2);
            // service player before servicing other
            // things that might affect the player
        spService (player, playersigs);
            // service other things
