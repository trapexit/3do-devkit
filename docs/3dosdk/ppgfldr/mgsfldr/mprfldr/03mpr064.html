<A NAME="XREF25474"></A> Mix control signals.<P>
<H3>Function</H3>
This instrument is the A*B+C modulator, which is useful for mixing control signals. The result is clipped to -$8000 and +$7FFF, the range of signed values.  This limits its usefulness with sample players that use unsigned frequency between 0 and $FFFF.<P>
<H3>Notes</H3>
Multiplying 0x8000 by 0x8000 causes an overflow yielding a result of 0x8000.  This means that (-1) x (-1) = (-1).  Thus, if you multiply a signal by 0x8000, it will pop if the signal also contains 0x8000.<P>
