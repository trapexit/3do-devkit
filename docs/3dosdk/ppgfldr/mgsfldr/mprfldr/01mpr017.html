<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>Item CreateEnvelope (DataTimePair *Points, int32 Numpoints,int32 SustainBegin, int32 SustainEnd)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Creates an envelope for a sample or a cue. Envelopes are described by an array of pairs of time and data. It can be used to specify a loop for sustained sound. <P>
Data typically ranges from -32,768 to 32,767 or 0 to 65,535, and must be sign-extended to 32 bits. Loops are specified as point indices. For more information, read the description of envelopes in the Music Programmer's Guide. <P>
When you are finished with the envelope, you should call <CODE>DeleteEnvelope()</CODE> to delete it and deallocate its resources. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>Points
<DD>An array of DataTimePair values giving delta time in milliseconds accompanied by data values. This becomes the value of the envelope item's AF_TAG_ADDRESS tag argument described in SetAudioItemInfo(). The Points array is not copied: it must remain valid for the life of the Envelope Item or until it is replaced with another array of Points by a call to <CODE>SetAudioItemInfo()</CODE>. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>NumPoints
<DD>The number of points in the array. This becomes the value of the envelope item's AF_TAG_FRAMES tag argument. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>SustainBegin
<DD>The beginning index of the loop. This becomes the value of the envelope 
item's AF_TAG_SUSTAINBEGIN tag argument. Set to - 1 for no sustain loop.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>SustainEnd
<DD>The ending index of the loop. This becomes the value of the envelope item's AF_TAG_SUSTAINEND tag argument. Set to -1 for no sustain loop. Otherwise must be &gt;= SustainBegin. 
</DL>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
The function returns the item number of the envelope (a positive value) or an error code (a negative value) if an error occurs. <P>
<H3>Implementation</H3>
Folio call implemented in Audio folio V20. <P>
