<H3>Function</H3>
This instrument is a rate-variable 8-bit sample player. <P>
This instrument is limited to a pitch one octave above base pitch, if recorded at 44.1 kHz.  If it is recorded at 22 kHz, the pitch can go two octaves up.  A rate of 0x8000 corresponds to one data sample per DAC sample frame.  0xFFFF is the highest possible rate. <P>
<H3>Knobs</H3>
Frequency  -  units are fixed point phase increment.  $8000 equals the normal sample rate, with 1 sample per frame.  Thus, you can go from zero to one octave above the original. <P>
