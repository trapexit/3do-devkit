<A NAME="XREF34821"></A> Determines if SPPlayer is currently reading from a particular SPSound.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>bool spIsSoundInUse (const SPSound *sound)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Determines if SPPlayer is currently reading from a particular SPSound. An SPSound cannot be removed from its owning SPPlayer while it is being read from while the player is running. This function is necessary for a client to know when it is safe to remove an SPSound. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>sound
<DD>Pointer to SPSound to test. 
</DL>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
TRUE if sound is currently being read by player; FALSE otherwise. <P>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
Returns FALSE too early for Sample Item class SPSounds. Since the spooler is given a pointer to the Sample Item's memory directly, rather than copying it into the spooler buffers, it must not return FALSE until a Sample Item SPSound has actually finished playing, not finished being read. <P>
<H3>Implementation</H3>
Library call implemented in music.lib V24. <P>
