<A NAME="XREF21481"></A> Decompress a 4-bit Intel/DVI format  sample.<P>
<H3>Function</H3>
This instrument is the adaptive delta pulse code modulation library routine.  It is used internally when it is called by other adpcm routines to implement the decompression of 4-bit samples.  Load this instrument using <CODE>LoadInstrument()</CODE> before loading other adpcm instruments. <P>
Sound samples are compressed from 16-bit samples to 4-bit samples using the SoundHack program.   These 4- bit samples are in the standard Intel/DVI format.  This library routine decompresses the 4-bit samples so that they can be played by other adpcm instruments. <P>
