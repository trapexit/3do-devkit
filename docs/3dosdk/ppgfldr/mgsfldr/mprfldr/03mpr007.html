<H3>Function</H3>
This instrument plays a square/xact/delta/stereocompressed sample at a fixed rate.  This is a 2:1 compression.  The compression is done by SquashSnd or SoundHack.   This instrument plays a sample that was recorded at 22,050 hertz, playing it back at 44,100 hertz with interpolated values between samples to keep the sampled sound's original pitch and duration. <P>
