<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>Err spBranchAtMarker (SPSound *fromSound, const char *fromMarkerName, SPSound *toSound, const char *toMarkerName)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Sets up a static branch from one marker to another. Barring the result of a marker or default decision function, when the playback encounters the 'from' marker, the playback will skip to the 'to' marker seamlessly. <P>
Markers can have one of 3 static actions: continue, branch, or stop. This action can be changed at any time, including while the player is playing. <P>
