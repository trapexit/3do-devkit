<A NAME="XREF19444"></A> Variable-rate sample player with pitch modulation.<P>
<H3>Function</H3>
This is a composite instrument consisting of sampler.dsp with built-in pitch modulation. samplermod.dsp uses unsigned addition and clipping to generate a frequency range of 0 to $FFFF.<P>
The sampler frequency is computed as follows:  <P>
SamplerFrequency = Frequency + ModInput * ModDepth <P>

<DL>
<DT>Frequency
<DD>Units are fixed point phase increment. $8000 equals the normal sample rate, with 1 sample per frame. Thus, you can go from zero to one octave above the original. Defaults  to $8000. Range is 0..$FFFF.

<DL>
<DT>Amplitude
<DD> 0..$7FFF. Defaults to $7FFF. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>ModInput
<DD>Pitch modulation signal (e.g. output of triangle_lfo.dsp) in the range of -$8000..$7fff. Defaults to 0. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>ModDepth
<DD>Gain of pitch modulation in the range of -$8000..$7fff. Defaults to 0.
