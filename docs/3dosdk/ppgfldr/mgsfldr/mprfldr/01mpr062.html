Err ReleaseInstrumentVA (Item Instrument, uint32 tag1, ...)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
This tells an Instrument to progress into its "release phase" if it hasn't already done so. This is equivalent to a MIDI Note Off event. Any Samples or Envelopes that are attached are set to their release portion, which may or may not involve a release loop. The sound may continue to be produced indefinitely depending on the release characteristics of the instrument. <P>
This has no audible effect on instruments that don't have some kind of sustain loop (e.g. sawtooth.dsp). <P>
Affects only instruments in the AF_STARTED state: sets them to the AF_RELEASED state. By default if and when an instrument reaches the end of its release phase, it stays in the AF_RELEASED state until explicitly changed (e.g. <CODE>StartInstrument()</CODE>, <CODE>StopInstrument()</CODE>). If one of this Instrument's running Attachments has the AF_ATTF_FATLADYSINGS flag set, the Instrument is automatically stopped when that Attachment completes. In that case, the instrument goes into the AF_STOPPED state, or, if the Instrument has the AF_INSF_AUTOABANDON flag set, the AF_ABANDONED state. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>Instrument
<DD>The item number for the instrument. 
</DL>
<H3>Tags</H3>
<DL>
<DT>AF_TAG_TIME_SCALE
<DD>(ufrac16) Scale times for all Envelopes attached to this Instrument. Original value is derived from the AF_TAG_TIME_SCALE provided when the Envelope Attachment was made. This value remains in effect until another AF_TAG_TIME_SCALE is passed to <CODE>StartInstrument()</CODE> or <CODE>ReleaseInstrument()</CODE>. 
</DL>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
The function returns a non-negative value if successful or an error code (a negative value) if an error occurs. <P>
<H3>Implementation</H3>
SWI implemented in Audio folio V20. <P>
