<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>Err spPause (SPPlayer *player)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Pauses playback of an SPPlayer. Use this to stop playback dead in its tracks and be able to pick up at the same spot. This differs from <CODE>spStop()</CODE>  in that playback cannot be restarted at the position at which <CODE>spStop()</CODE>  occurred. Resume playback with <CODE>spResume()</CODE>. <P>
Sets SP_STATUS_F_PAUSED. Calling <CODE>spPause()</CODE> multiple times has no effect, the calls do not nest. Calling <CODE>spPause()</CODE> while the SPPlayer's SP_STATUS_F_PLAYING flag is not set has no effect. The paused state is superceded by a call to <CODE>spStop()</CODE> or <CODE>spStartPlaying()</CODE>. <P>
There is presently no way to know if an SPPlayer is paused. <P>
Data can still be spooled while paused if there were any completed buffers prior to pausing. <P>
