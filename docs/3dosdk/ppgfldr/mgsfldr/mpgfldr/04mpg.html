This chapter, the second of two on audio programming, shows how to use the instruments you have set up. Once an instrument environment is set up, by creating instruments and attachments, grabbing and tweaking knobs, connecting instruments, setting tunings, and so on, your task can play the instruments. To do so, a task uses start, stop, release calls to turn notes on and off, and timing calls to measure the time between note control calls.<P>
