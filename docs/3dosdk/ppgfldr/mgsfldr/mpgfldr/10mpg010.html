<H2>3-D sound</H2>
<B>Q: </B>  How can I create 3-D sound?<P>
<B>A: </B>  Real-time 3D Sound generated by the 3DO DSPP is not yet supported.<P>
You can encode a stereo soundtrack using a variety of commercially available techniques, including Q-Sound or Dolby Pro-Logic  encoder, and then play them back just like any other stereo soundtrack with the sound file player, DataStreamer, etc. The Dolby encoded soundtracks requires a Surround Sound decoder and a home theatre system to hear the 3D effect.<P>
