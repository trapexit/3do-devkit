<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>tsc_soundfx</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Demonstrate use of ScoreContext as a simple sound effects manager. This 
gives you dynamic voice allocation, and a simple MIDI-like interface. <P>
To run this program: <P>
1) Install the sample library from the recent 3DO tools disk as 
documented. <P>
If you don't have the sample library, edit this program to use your own 
samples. Search for .aiff. <P>
2) Run the program, follow printed instructions. <P>
The idea behind this program is that one can use the virtual MIDI routines 
in the music library as a simple sound effects manager. You can assign 
samples to channels, and then pay those samples using 
<CODE>StartScoreNote()</CODE>. This will take advantage of the voice 
allocation, automatic mixer connections, and other management code already 
used for playing scores. You do not have to play sequences or load MIDI 
files to do this. <P>
You can load your samples based on a PIMap text file using the 
<CODE>LoadPIMap()</CODE> routine. This is documented in the manual under 
score playing. You may also load the samples yourself and put them in the 
PIMap which will give you more control. This example program shows you how 
to do that. Samples are assigned to Program Numbers at this step. <P>
Assigning program numbers to channels is accomplished by calling 
<CODE>ChangeScoreProgram()</CODE>. Once you have assigned a program to a 
channel, you can play the sound by calling: <P>
<DL>
<DD><CODE>StartScoreNote (scon, Channel, Note, Velocity); </CODE><BR>
</DL>
Channel selects the sound. Note determines the pitch and may also be used 
to select parts of a multisample, e.g. a drum kit. Velocity controls 
loudness. The voice allocation occurs during this call. <P>
<H3>Implementation</H3>
This example was revised to take advantage of a change made for music.lib 
V22 to permit playing multiple voices per MIDI node, which greatly 
facilitates sound effects playback. <P>

<H3>Notes</H3>
1) Prior to music.lib V22, if you wanted to get multiple voices on a given 
channel, you had to use different note values. The allocator would only 
assign one voice to any given note number, regardless of MaxVoices. 
music.lib V22 supports having more than one voice per note number. Earlier 
versions of this example demonstrated a way around this by using a 
different note for each voice on a channel. Since this trick is no longer 
necessary and is somewhat less than straightforward, this example has been 
modified to take advantage of the V22 feature of multiple voices per 
notes. <P>
2) Prior to music.lib V24, you needed to be careful when assigning high 
priorities. Higher priority instruments never got stolen for lower 
priority instruments in that scheme. Thus you could clog up the DSPP if 
you have a high priority instrument with MaxVoices&gt;1 and are also 
trying to play lower priority instruments. Starting with music.lib V24, 
higher priority instruments can be stolen by lower priority instruments if 
the higher priority instruments are stopped. As in the original voice 
stealing algorithm, voices do not get stolen from higher priority 
instruments if they are still playing at all (started or released). <P>
3) Samples that are attached to an InsTemplate are deleted when the 
Template is deleted. You can detach the sample first by calling 
<CODE>DeleteAttachment()</CODE> if you don't want this to happen. <P>
4) You can share the ScoreContext with code that plays a score as long as 
you don't overlap the channels or program numbers. You might restrict 
scores to channels 0-7 and programs 0-19. You could then use channels 8-15 
and programs 20-39 for sound effects. The advantage of this is that they 
share the same voice allocation and thus resources will be shared between 
them. If desired, you could instead use separate independent 
ScoreContexts. <P>
