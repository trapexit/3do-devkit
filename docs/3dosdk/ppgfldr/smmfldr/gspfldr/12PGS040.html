<A NAME="XREF11410"></A>Measures the maximum and minimum output from the 
DSP.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>minmax_audio</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Samples the output of the DSP and returns its maximum and minimum output 
values. You can use minmax_audio to check that your program outputs are 
reasonable, non-clipping levels of audio. <P>
The program creates instances of probes from the instruments minimum.dsp 
and maximum.dsp. The probes are queried with <CODE>ReadProbe()</CODE> 
every five seconds, or 5*240 audio ticks. <P>
In Opera hardware, the DSP implementation is 16-bit; therefore, the output 
for the left and right channels range from 32767 to -32768. <P>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
The loudness of audio is often subjective. Check the loudness of your 
program by first playing a standard audio CD on a development station, and 
adjusting the volume of your sound system to a reasonable level. The 3DO 
program should then produce sounds at a similar volume. <P>
