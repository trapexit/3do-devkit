<H3>Description</H3>
This program demonstrates the programming of a basic player/target game 
which is controlled via the control pad or mouse. It illustrates the 
convenience routines <CODE>GetMouse()</CODE> and 
<CODE>GetControlPad(</CODE>. <P>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
While the control pad and mouse convenience routines is fine for certain 
titles, titles that require a high level of performance should use the 
Event Broker directly. This is particularly true if you want to put 
peripheral input handling in its own thread. <P>
See the BrokerShell example program for programming directly to the Event 
Broker. <P>
