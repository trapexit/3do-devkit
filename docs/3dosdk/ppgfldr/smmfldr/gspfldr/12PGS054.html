<CODE>symanim</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
This program animates the 3 components of the 3DO logo on top of a 
background display. While the program is running, the user can do the 
following: <P>
<UL>
<LI>A button-Adds a set of 3 components to the animation. 
<LI>B button-Starts rotating the components in 2D. Pressing the button 
starts 3D rotation. Pressing the button again stops rotation. 
<LI>C button-Starts to rapidly resize the components from large to small 
and back. Pressing the button again stops this. 
<LI>P button-Pauses and unpauses the animation. 
<LI>X button-Exits the program. 
</UL>
The program adapts to NTSC vs. PAL automatically. Upon startup, the 
program loads in an image file to use as a backdrop. It also loads three 
ANIM files to use for the three components of the 3DO logo. Different 
versions of the pictures are loaded depending on whether the display is 
NTSC or PAL. <P>
Once all components are loaded, a screen group with two screens is 
created. The two screens are used for double-buffering. Throughout the 
animation, we use a SPORT transfer to copy the backdrop image from its 
buffer into the screen buffer that is not currently displayed. We then 
render the current set of components onto the screen buffer. Once all this 
is completed, we swap screen buffers, which makes the rendering visible. 
The cycle starts again with the newly hidden screen buffer. <P>
