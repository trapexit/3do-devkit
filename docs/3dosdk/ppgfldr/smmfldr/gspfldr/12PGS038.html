<H3>Description</H3>
This program demonstrates the features of the memory debugging subsystem. 
<P>
The memory debugging subsystem helps you make sure that your application 
is freeing all of its memory, not stomping on innocent memory areas, and 
generally doing illegal things to the Portfolio memory manager. As it 
detects errors and illegal operations, it displays information in the 
Debugger Terminal window. <P>
For more information about the memory debugging subsystem, refer to the 
documentation for the <CODE>CreateMemDebug()</CODE> function. <P>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
This program intentionally does a some illegal things. Don't do this in 
your programs!<P>
