This section describes five sample programs for the mouse peripheral 
provided with the Portfolio operating system software.<P>
Sample programs are included in the operating system software (in the 
<I>3DO:examples:Eventbroker</I> folder) and are installed automatically 
with the operating system. Updates are provided on the 3DO 
InfoServer bulletin board (415.261.3405). Contact the Developer Technical 
Support staff on the InfoLine (415.261.3400) for additional 
information.<P>
<CODE>cpdump.c</CODE><P>
Sends the event broker several requests for information and interprets the 
replies. Asks for (and prints) a list of control port devices currently 
hooked up to the bus, as well as a list of listeners.<P>
<CODE>focus.c</CODE><P>
Asks the event broker to tell it which listener has the "focus of 
attention," or instructs the event broker to take the focus of attention 
away from one listener and assign it to another.<P>
<CODE>lookie.c</CODE><P>
Uses the direct (low-level) interface to the event broker. Asks the event 
broker to send it a large class of events, including most of the control 
pad events, most of the mouse events, as well as several miscellaneous 
events; for example, change of the control port configuration and loss of 
events. Whenever <CODE>lookie</CODE> receives an event message from the 
event broker, it scans the message and prints the contents of each event 
frame.<P>
<CODE>luckie.c</CODE><P>
Uses the event broker's "convenience interface" to watch for and print the 
button settings of the first control pad whenever they change. The code 
registers with the convenience interface, then calls 
<CODE>GetControlPad</CODE> ("go to sleep until the settings for control 
pad #1 change, then return the settings to me"). Whenever the call to 
<CODE>GetControlPad</CODE> returns, <CODE>luckie</CODE> prints the 
settings and calls <CODE>GetControlPad</CODE> again.<P>
<CODE>maus.c</CODE><P>
Similar to <CODE>luckie,</CODE> but monitors first mouse. Prints current 
mouse position each time the event broker reports it has changed.<P>
