<H3>Description</H3>
Simple program demonstrating how to use the compression routines supplied 
by compression folio. The program loads itself into a memory buffer, 
compresses the data, decompresses it, and compares the original data with 
the decompressed data to make sure the compression and decompression 
processes worked successfully. <P>
