<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>colorecho [-g] [-m]</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Displays graphic patterns which are created by drawing a zoomed and 
rotated image of the screen back into the screen. This is similar to the 
effect achieved by pointing a television camera at a monitor showing the 
image from the camera: You see an image of the monitor on the monitor. The 
monitor image contains the same image and so on. This recursive feedback 
can generate fractal patterns in real time. <P>
