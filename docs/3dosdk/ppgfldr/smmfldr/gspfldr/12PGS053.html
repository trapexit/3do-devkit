<H3>Description</H3>
Storagetuner is an example program which can easily be dropped into your 
title's code to allow end users to delete files in NVRAM. This gives your 
title a user-friendly way of making space for saving scores or states. 
Several titles have already used this mechanism so consumers are starting 
to accept it as a standard. <P>
Feel free to modify the art work provided to give the storagetuner a feel 
that more closely approximates your own title. You may remove the 3DO 
licensed product symbol used in the example. If you don't, take care not 
to use it improperly.<P>
