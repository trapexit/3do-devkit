<CODE>ta_pitchnotes [&lt;sample file&gt; [&lt;duration&gt;]]</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
This program loads and plays the AIFF sample file at several different pitches. It does this by selecting a MIDI note number, which the audio folio maps to a frequency. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>sample file
<DD>Name of a sample to be played. The sample should be compatible with sampler.dsp (16-bit monophonic).
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>duration
<DD>Duration of each note, in audio ticks. Defaults to 240.
</DL>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
Because this sample program uses <CODE>SleepaudioTicks()</CODE>, the notes are not necessarily rhythmic. Use the juggler to play rhythmic scores. <P>
