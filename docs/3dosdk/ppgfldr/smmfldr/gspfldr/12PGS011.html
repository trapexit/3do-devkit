<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>capture_audio [&lt;num frames&gt;] [&lt;dest file&gt;]</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Captures the output from the DSP into a file on the development station's 
filesystem. It can be used to check the sound output of a program at 
important points. <P>
Once the output from the DSP has been captured, you can load it into 
SoundHack and edit it as follows: <P>
1. From the File menu in SoundHack, choose Open Any.<P>
2. Select the file that was captured with capture_audio. <P>
3. Use the Header Change command and set the captured file's header to a 
rate of 44100, with 2 channels, and a format of 16-bit Linear. <P>
4. Select Save As command and save the sound file as a 16-bit AIFF format 
file.<P>
You can then load the AIFF file you created and listen to the captured 
sounds. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>num frames 
<DD> Number of sample frames to capture. Defaults to 10000.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>dest file
<DD>Name of the file to save the captured frames to. Defaults to 
capture.raw.
</DL>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
This program adds an instrument at priority 0. Because the execution order 
of equal priority instruments depends isn't as predictable as those of 
differing priority, this program may not be able to capture from other 
instruments at priority 0. <P>
