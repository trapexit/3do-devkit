<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>lrex &lt;imagefile&gt;</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Demonstrates how to extract a cel from a frame buffer or bitmap image, 
that can then be redrawn into the frame buffer. Can be used for things 
like breaking up a static or dynamic image (like the video in Mystery 
Matinee in Twisted) and reorganizing it. <P>
Subcel extraction from a frame buffer (bitmap) is slightly different from 
extraction from another cel. This program handles extraction from bitmaps 
only. <P>
The extraction can easily be done with the appropriate call to the Lib3DO 
functions (CreateLRFormCel), but this example shows how to do it long 
hand. <P>
When extracting from bitmaps, pay attention to the order in which the 
pixels are represented. <P>
The program is based on animsample and aaplayer. The user can manipulate 
the extracted cel. <P>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
In performing the cel manipulation, the source for the cel may end up 
pointing to garbage. This is especially likely if the program is 
distorting the cel near the edge of the extracting bitmap. <P>
You can only extract a cel from even lines of the bitmap. This restriction 
arises out of the way bitmaps are laid out and lrfrom cels are drawn. You 
can extract from odd lines, but the cel will not be pixel accurate in 
relation to the source you are extracting from. <P>
