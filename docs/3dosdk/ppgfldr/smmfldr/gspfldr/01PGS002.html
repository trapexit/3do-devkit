<H1><LINK NAME="XREF30217">Preparing a Program</LINK></H1><HR>
Preparing a program for the first time involves two steps discussed in 
this section: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Creating the makefile-use your own makefile or follow the process 
described in "<A HREF="#XREF34495">Creating a Makefile Using 
Create3DOMake</A>" below.
<p>
<LI><A HREF="#XREF19737">Building the Program</A>
</UL>
<H3>For More Information</H3>
More information about the ARM compiler, linker and assembler is in 3DO 
Tools for Programming III (blue cover). For optimizing your code, pay 
special attention to the "ARM Cookbook" in that volume. <P>
<A NAME="XREF34495"><H2>Creating a Makefile Using Create3DOMake</A></H2>
The Create3DOMake MPW tool creates a simple makefile for building a 3DO 
program. After you've installed the 3DO software from the installation 
disc and have moved the Userstartup3DO file into your MPW folder, a 3DO 
menu becomes available from MPW. <P>
When you select the Create 3DO Makefile command in the 3DO menu, a dialog 
appears that lets you define the makefile. As you specify options, a 
Command Line section in the dialog is filled in.<P>
The program for which you create the makefile may be written in any 
combination of Assembly Language, C, C++, or Rez. When you run the 
makefile, it will copy the successfully built program to the {3DORemote} 
folder. If you checked "Symbolic debugger information," the makefile also 
copies the symbol file to the {3DORemote} folder.<P>
After the tool is installed, you can use it from the command line or via 
the graphical user interface as follows: <P>
<OL>
<LI>From the 3DO menu in MPW, select Create 3DO Makefile. A dialog lets you choose options for the program:<P>
<p>

<P>
<B>Figure 1: </B><I>Create3DO Make dialog.</I><P>
<p>
<LI>Provide the program name (name of the executable), for example UFO. 
<p>
<LI>Click the Source Files button. 
<p>
<LI>In the file selection dialog that appears, select your source files. 
<p>
<p>The program name and one source file are the only obligatory arguments.
<p>
<LI>Check the boxes for additional options as follows: 
<p>
<UL>
<LI>"Include streaming libraries" includes references to the DataStreamer 
libraries in the makefile. Check this box if you use DataStreamer calls.
<p>
<LI>"Create source directory script," creates a .spt file that can be used 
by the 3DO Debugger to find source directory information. 
<p>
<LI>"Symbolic debugger information" writes a makefile that generates a 
symbols file you can use for debugging source code. 
</UL><BR>
<p>
<p><B>Caution: </B>The options "Include 3D libraries and "Enable memory 
leaks detection" are currently not valid. <BR>
<p>
As you enter the information, the Command Line section is updated 
accordingly. The illustration below shows a completed dialog box for 
creating a program named UFO that includes symbolic debugging information 
but none of the other options.<P>

<LI>When you've selected all desired options, choose the Create3DOMake 
button and the script builds a makefile.
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B>In case of complex dependencies among header files, use the 
makefile created by Create3DOMake as a starting point, then add special 
dependencies in the appropriate section. <P>
</OL>
<A NAME="XREF19737"><H2>Building the Program</A></H2>
Use the following procedure to build the program: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Place all source and data files and the makefile in the same folder. 
<p>
<LI>From the Directory menu in MPW, choose Set Directory to set the folder 
that contains the makefile and source files for the next build. If you're 
currently in the directory, choose "Select Current Directory."
<p>
<LI>From the Build menu, choose Build (or Full Build).
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Build rebuilds the program taking into account sources that changed. 
<LI>Full Build rebuilds everything, regardless of changes. 
</UL>
<p>
<LI>Enter the name of the executable, as specified in the makefile, when 
prompted. 
</OL>
MPW compiles and links the program, using the commands in the makefile. If 
you're using a makefile generated by Create3DOMake, a copy of the 
executable and of the .sym file-if "Symbolic debugger information" was 
selected-are placed into $boot. The $boot variable evaluates to /remote or 
/cd-rom.<P>
After MPW has created the executables, you can test the program on the 3DO 
system using the 3DO Debugger as your interface to the 3DO hardware. For 
more information, see the <I>3DO Debugger Programmer's Guide</I> in the 
volume "3DO Tools for Programming I" that is part of the Toolkit 
documentation set (blue cover).<P>
If compilation does not work, you need to resolve the error messages 
provided in the MPW worksheet. <P>
