<H3>Description</H3>
Demonstrates how to save data to a file in NVRAM or to any other writable 
device. <P>
The <CODE>SaveDataFile()</CODE> function takes a name, a data pointer, and 
a size indicator, and creates a file of that name and size, containing the 
supplied data. <P>
Writing data to a file requires a bit of finesse. Data can only be written 
in blocks, not bytes. If the data being written is not a multiple of the 
target device's blocksize, the last chunk of data must be copied to a 
buffer which is the size of a block, and the block can then be written. <P>
