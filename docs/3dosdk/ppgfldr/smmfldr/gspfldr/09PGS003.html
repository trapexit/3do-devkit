A calibration algorithm is provided (in <I>Examples:event broker:lightgun: 
lightgun.c</I>) to handle the effects of a splitter and daisy-chain 
placement on timing.<P>
Because the light gun is inherently inaccurate, the time value calibration 
routines average two valid sensor readings into one value. Even so, expect 
x,y values to be plus or minus three pixels (or more) from the pixel the gun is 
actually pointing at.<P>
Example programs showing how the light gun and the event broker interact 
are provided in the <I>3DO:examples:Eventbroker</I> folder. This folder is 
automatically installed with this version of 3DO Portfolio.<P>
