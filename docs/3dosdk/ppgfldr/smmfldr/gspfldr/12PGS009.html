<H3>Description</H3>
This is a small demo program where each of the elements of the 3DO logo 
bounce around a 3D room. The logo elements distort upon contact with the 
walls and floor. Shadows of the logo elements follow along with the 
objects. The room can be lit at two different levels. <P>
The code which supports the generation of sound is bracketed with: <P>
