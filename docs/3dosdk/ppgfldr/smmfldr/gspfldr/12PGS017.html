<H3>Description</H3>
Utility code for basic management of mixers and sound effects. <P>
Typical usage scenario: <P>
During program initialization: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Open the audio folio. 
<LI>Call <CODE>ehInitEffectsHandler()</CODE> to allocate and initialize 
the effects handler.
<LI>Call <CODE>ehNewMixerInfo()</CODE> to load a mixer and initialize a 
mixerInfo structure. 
<LI>Call <CODE>ehLoadSoundEffect()</CODE> to load a sample as a sound 
effect and initialize a sampleInfo structure. 
<LI>Optionally call <CODE>ehSetChannelLevels()</CODE> for each sound 
effect. 
</UL>
As needed during execution:<P>
<UL>
<LI> Call <CODE>ehSetChannelLevels()</CODE> for a given sound effect to 
adjust its player's output levels. Issue calls which control the sound 
effects player instrument (the SampleInfo's si_Player structure member).
</UL>
During program termination: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Call <CODE>ehDisposeSampleInfo()</CODE> for each sound effect. 
<LI>Call <CODE>ehDisposeMixerInfo()</CODE> for the mixer. 
<LI>Call <CODE>ehKillEffectsHandler()</CODE>. Close the audio folio. 
</UL>
Depending on program requirements, you may want to load one or more sound 
effects and assemble their player apparati but not immediately connect 
them to a mixer. This is accomplished by calling 
<CODE>ehNewSampleInfo()</CODE> and <CODE>ehSetupSamplePlayer()</CODE>. 
When you want to connect the player to the mixer, call 
<CODE>ehConnectSamplePlayer()</CODE>. <P>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
This program is not a complete sound management facility. <P>
