<A NAME="XREF38602"><H2>How a Light Gun Works</A></H2>
With CRT displays, the light gun reports the time lapse between the 
beginning of a field (vertical blank) and when the scan beam passes into 
the field of view of the gun's light sensor. Based on the timer values the 
light gun returns, positions are calculated from the time elapsed between 
the start of one scan line and the start of one immediately below it 
(YSCANTIME); x values (XSCANTIME) are determined by the time it takes to 
draw from the first to last pixel on one scan line. A third value, 
TIMEOFFSET, is based on the time lapse between when a field begins and 
when a scan beam begins drawing to the first pixel on the first scan 
line.<P>
The NTSC and PAL standards require slightly different values for these 
time constants. This is to account for the different screen resolution and 
the speed at which the electron beam draws in the display. The time values 
are provided in the <I>lightgun.h</I> file.<P>
The light gun does not work with PCs because of 
variation in refresh rates and electron beam gun speed among monitors. <P>
The light gun does not work with LCD displays.<P>
The illustration below shows the light gun and cable with male DB9 
connector.<P>
