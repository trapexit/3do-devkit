<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>int32 DoControlPad (int32 whichPad, uint32 *pButton,int32 
continuousBits)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Queries the state of the specified control pad, and de-bounces the keys, 
based upon which keys the user is interested in receiving continuous data 
on button presses, or discrete data. <P>
This function fills pButton with the current state of the control pad. 
That is, it returns values defined in event.h: <P>
ControlUp 
ControlDown
ControlLeft 
ControlRight
ControlA 
ControlB 
ControlC 
ControlStart 
ControlX 
ControlLeftShift 
ControlRightShift <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>whichPad
<DD>Index of the control pad to query 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>pButton
<DD>Pointer to a uint32, in which the state of the requested control pad 
is returned. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>continuousBits
<DD>Events from event.h for which the user would like to get a continuous 
stream of event states. 
</DL>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
Returns 0 if successful or a negative error code if an error occurs. <P>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
This function is neither multi-thread or multi-task capable or safe. You 
should call this from the task or thread which has already called 
<CODE>InitControlPad()</CODE>. This is because of system restrictions on 
item ownership and using items. <CODE>InitControlPad()</CODE> and 
<CODE>InitEventUtility()</CODE> create message ports and message items, 
which only the task which has created them can use. Hence, 
<CODE>DoControlPad()</CODE> can only be called by that same task. Other 
tasks or threads which attempt this, will get errors due to not owning the 
appropriate message ports and messages. <P>
To make this multi-thread capable, you would need to spawn off a thread 
that communicates directly with the event broker, and with all the other 
tasks that will consume event information. <P>
