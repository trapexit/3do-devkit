sound player.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>tsp_rooms</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Creates a thread to playback a sound track based on a global room variable 
gRoom. <P>
The parent task, tsp_rooms, gets control port events and updates gRoom as 
follows: <P>
<UL>
<LI>A -Enter room A. 
<LI>B-Enter room B.
<LI>C - Enter room C. 
<LI>X (Stop)-Exit nicely. 
<LI>Shift-X-Stop immediately. 
</UL>
The soundtrack thread, Soundtrack, uses the advanced sound player to play 
a unique sound file for each room. When the main task changes rooms, the 
soundtrack thread adapts the soundtrack to the change in room at a 
musically convenient location. <P>
The way this is done is that each room's soundfile is designed so it can 
play in a loop. In addition to this, the end of each sound file, and 
additional optional marked locations within the sound file, must be 
musically sensible locations to transition to the beginning of any of the 
other room's sound files. When playback reaches the next marked position 
in, or the end of, the current room's sound, a default decision function 
is called to check to see if the main task changed room. If the room is 
still the same, then the current sound continues to play, or loops if at 
the end. <P>
If the room has changed, the SPPlayer is instructed to begin playing the 
sound for the new room. <P>
Note that the soundtrack adapts to room changes by the main task instead 
of making a sharp transition as soon as the room changes. It is possible 
for the main task to make several room changes before the soundtrack 
thread discovers that the room has changed at all. This results in smooth 
soundtrack transitions that occur at seemingly random locations, which is 
far less likely to become annoying to a game player than a soundtrack that 
predictably changes the instant the player crosses a given threshold. <P>
