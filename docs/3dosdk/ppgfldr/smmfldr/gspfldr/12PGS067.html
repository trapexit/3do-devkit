<H3>Description</H3>
This program tests the juggler using non-musical events and software-based 
"timing." It constructs two synthetic sequences based on the TestData data 
structure, and creates a collection based on these two sequences. It then 
"plays" the collection via a simple print function, processed at the time 
of each event in each sequence. <P>
