<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>tsp_switcher</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Loops one of three sound files off of disc. The user can select a 
different sound to loop by pressing the A, B, or C buttons on the control 
pad. The last button pressed corresponds to the sound being played. <P>
This program demonstrates how one might use the advanced sound player as 
an engine for doing environmentally-sensitive soundtrack playback. Note 
that the sound being played doesn't change to the newly selected one until 
the end of the current sound is reached. This demonstrates, for example 
how a score might be made to change at the next musically sensible point. 
See tsp_rooms for another way to do this. <P>
