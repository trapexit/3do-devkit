<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>perftest</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Perftest can give the developer an idea of how adding cels can affect performance. The control pad has the following functions: <P>
<UL>
<LI>A Button-Add a 16-bit uncoded cel (bouncing ball). 
<LI>B Button-Toggle between using one or two cel engines. 
<LI>C Button-Remove a 16-bit uncoded cel (bouncing ball). 
</UL>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
The cels used in this example are expensive to render and not well-suited for titles attempting to maximize performance. <P>
The example contains a large amount of code which has been marked with #ifdef and may be difficult to follow at times. <P>
