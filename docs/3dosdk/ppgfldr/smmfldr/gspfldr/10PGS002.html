Some extended joysticks have a female DB-9 connector and therefore can be daisy-chained with other control port peripherals. See <A HREF="./08PGS002.html#XREF12865"> Daisy-chaining peripherals</A> for more information.<P>

The extended joystick driver is included in the operating system software and installs automatically when you install the operating system.
