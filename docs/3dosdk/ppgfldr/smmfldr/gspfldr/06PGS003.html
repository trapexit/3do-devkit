<H3>What is it:</H3>
A program relies on tasks running in a certain order without assigning priorities<P>
<H3>Why it's bad:</H3>
If a program relies on the order of tasks without setting priorities, the order may be different when running via the Macintosh than when running off a CD-ROM. It's even more likely that the order is different in a future operating system.<P>
<H3>What to do</H3>
Use priorities. Don't change timing inside the code, since this may not reliably work in a future operating system.<P>
