<H3>Description</H3>
Demonstrates the use of threads and signals. <P>
The <CODE>main()</CODE> routine launches two threads. These threads sit in 
a loop and count. After a given number of iterations through their loop, 
they send a signal to the parent task. When the parent task gets a signal, 
it wakes up and prints the current counters of the threads to show how 
much they were able to count. <P>
