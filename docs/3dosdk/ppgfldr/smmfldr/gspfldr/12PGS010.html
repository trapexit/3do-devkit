<H3>Description</H3>
This demonstration program lets you move a cel (a cloud) around the screen 
with a joystick and leave an image of it on the screen when you press the 
trigger. You can also distort the cel and clear the screen. The program 
supports control pad, joystick, and mouse interaction.<P>
This example illustrates how to use the broker shell peripheral 
interaction utilities. <P>
The connection/configuration/disconnection routines can be used as-is in 
final code. <P>
The data interaction/processing is less efficient than it could be for the 
sake of modularity, comprehensibility, and flexibility. If you unpack 
the<CODE> BS_NiceWaitEvent()</CODE> and <CODE>BS_ProcessXxxData()</CODE> 
routines and perform that processing in a more direct way performance will 
improve. You should also eliminate any debouncing checks that you don't 
use. <P>
