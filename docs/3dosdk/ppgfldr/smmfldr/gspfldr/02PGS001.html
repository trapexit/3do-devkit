The <A

Programmer's Guide</A> provides a comprehensive 
discussion of 3DO graphics programming, supplemented by function 
descriptions for all functions in the<A

The volume

3DO art conversion tools and the <A

which is aimed at graphic artists but is useful for a more general 
audience as well. <P>
<A NAME="XREF37375"><H2>3DO Cels and Images</A></H2>
The two basic formats for 3DO graphics are 3DO images and 3DO cels. <P>
<UL>
<LI>A 3DO image is the simplest kind of 3DO graphic. For NTSC screens, it 
is a 320-x-240 array of 16-bit pixel values, laid out in the format of the 
display buffer (352 x 288 for PAL). The hardware can draw an image very 
quickly by copying it into the display buffer directly, but cannot process 
or compress images. jsbasicslideshow.c displays images in sequence based 
on user input. It's also possible to let the slide show run in stand-alone 
mode. 
<p>
<LI>A 3DO cel is more complex than an image. In addition to the raw pixel 
data, a cel has a header called a cel control block (CCB) that tells the 
cel engine how to draw the cel. A program can flip, rotate, stretch, or 
even "bow-tie" the cel as it is being displayed. You can also make parts 
of the cel transparent or translucent, or you can enhance its luminance, 
if the illustration has been prepared correctly using the 3DO PostPro 
tool, a Photoshop custom plug-in, or the 3DO Animator tool. Most of the 
Jumpstart2 example programs use cels. 
</UL>
There are several cel formats. The format depends on the number of bits 
per pixel and on whether the cel is indexed into a color table (coded) or 
not. <P>
<B>Note: </B>3DO animations consist of 3DO cels, and are discussed in <A

<A NAME="XREF16251"><H2>Uncoded and Coded Cels</A></H2>
Uncoded cels contain pixels with values that are turned directly into 
16-bit frame-pixel values. Uncoded cels offer a large number of colors but 
use more memory than coded cels.<P>
Coded cels are indexed into a color table. As a result, coded cels end up 
being much smaller than uncoded cels, as illustrated below. <P>

<B>Figure 1: </B><I>How uncoded and coded cels use the system color table. </I><P>
The color table is part of a pixel lookup table (PLUT). The PLUT contains 
the color table and may also contain extra bits to store information about 
how the pixel is displayed. A pixel may become partly transparent, may 
have its color enhanced by an alternate multiply value (AMV), or may be 
mixed with the background using a P-Mode setting. P-Mode (or Pixel-Mode) 
lets you change the display for predefined pixels or predefined colors. 
You can use P-Mode, for example, to make part of a cel translucent and 
part of a cel opaque, or to make part of a cel smoky or enhance its 
brightness.<P>
<A NAME="XREF41202"><H2>Commonly Used Cel Formats</A></H2>
Commonly used cel formats are 16-bit uncoded cels 8-bit or 6-bit coded 
cels:<P>
<UL>
<LI>16-bit uncoded cels store a full 15-bit RGB value for each pixel, 
allowing the cel to use the full range of display colors. Because each 
pixel takes up 2 bytes, these cels take twice as long to render as cels 
that use 8 or fewer bits per pixel. The topmost bit in a 16-bit uncoded 
cel is used for P-Mode. 
<p>
<LI>8-bit coded cels provide 32 colors and 7 additional shades of each 
color. They don't use much more space than 6-bit coded cels but provide 
far more colors. You can use the Coded-8 CelWriter, discussed in the 
<I>3DO Custom Plug-Ins and CCMs</I> manual in the volume "3DO Tools for 
Art Production," to create 8-bit coded cels. 
<p>
<LI>6-bit coded cels have only 32 colors. Each pixel is stored as a 5-bit 
index into a palette of 32 colors. The palette is user-definable, and can 
be unique to one cel or shared among many cels. The topmost bit in a 6-bit 
coded cel is used for P-Mode, just like the topmost bit in a 16-bit 
uncoded cel.
</UL>
3DO developers don't often use 8-bit uncoded cels, since they offer only 
256 colors and color distortion during cel creation can be quite 
noticeable. <P>
