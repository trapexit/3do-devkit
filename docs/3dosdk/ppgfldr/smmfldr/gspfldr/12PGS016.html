<H3>Synopsis</H3>
drumbox &lt;PIMap&gt;<P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Loads and plays up to eight rhythm sounds in a repeating measure of 
sixteen beats. Use the D-pad and the A button to place or remove a sound 
from a specific point in the rhythm. <P>
To use this program, it is necessary to copy the AIFF Samples folder into 
the 
/remote folder so that this program can use them. You can then define the 
location of the AIFF samples to the debugger by setting an alias in the 
debugger: <P>
 alias samples &lt;samples path&gt;<P>
where &lt;samples path&gt; is the location of the AIFF samples within the 
/remote folder. <P>
