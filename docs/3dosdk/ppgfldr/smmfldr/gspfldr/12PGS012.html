<H3>Description</H3>
This program plays a MIDI file using Juggler and Score toolbox from the 
music.lib and audio folio, and demonstrates special MIDI interpreter 
functions. <P>
The CoalRiver.pimap file references some AIFF samples which were included 
in the AIFF Samples folder. It is necessary to copy the AIFF Samples 
folder into the remote folder to use them in this program. To let this 
program know about the locations of the samples, use this command in the 
Debugger Terminal window:<P>
<DL>
<DD><CODE>alias samples &lt;sample path&gt; </CODE><BR>
</DL>
Then, the CoalRiver.pimap file will reference the appropriate samples. <P>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
No attempt was made to reduce the size of the samples. Most real-world 
titles use fewer or smaller samples. <P>
