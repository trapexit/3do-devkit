Daisy-chaining refers to linking two or more peripherals in series off the 
control port of a single 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system. Any 
combination of peripherals that have available female DB9 connectors can 
be daisy chained.<P>
To create a daisy chain, connect to the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system 
(or 3DO development system) to any peripheral that has a female DB9 
connector. Then plug the male DB9 connector of a second peripheral into 
the female DB9 connector of the first, and so on. <P>
A peripheral without a female DB9 connector must be the final device in a 
daisy chain.<P>
Because a theoretically unlimited number of peripherals can be 
daisy-chained, the control port has no fixed maximum number of devices. 
The number of devices that can be daisy-chained is limited only by the 
bandwidth of the port. When too many peripherals are linked (usually more 
than eight), the port becomes overwhelmed and fails to recognize the last 
device in the chain.<P>
