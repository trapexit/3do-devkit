 Sets new size for text in cel.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>Err SetTextCelSize (TextCel *tCel, int32 width, int32 
height)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Sets a new size for the text cel. If width and/or height are zero, the cel 
is set to a 1 x 1 pixel size initially, and each time text is placed into 
the cel the size automatically changes to reflect the size of the 
characters actually in the cel. <P>
Whenever you change a cel's size, you lose the cel's  current
    contents, because the data buffer is discarded and reallocated at the new
    size, and after allocation all pixels in the buffer are set to zero. <P>

allocated. <P>
