<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>ANIM * LoadAnim (char *fileName, uint32 memTypeBits)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Loads an animation file from disk. Parses the cels within the animation 
into an ANIM structure and returns a pointer to the ANIM. <P>
The animation file can be single-CCB or multi-CCB format. An optional ANIM 
chunk may appear at the start of the file. The file can contain pixel and 
color chunks in either PDAT, PLUT or PLUT, PDAT order, but the chunks must 
appear in the same order throughout the file. (3DO Animator creates PLUT, 
PDAT files; PDAT, PLUT files result from concatenating cel files using 
MPW.) <P>
When you are finished with the animation, use <CODE>UnloadAnim()</CODE> to 
free all resources acquired by <CODE>LoadAnim()</CODE> for a given 
animation file. <P>
The frames within an animation are allocated incrementally. Initially a 
block large enough to hold N_FRAMES_PER_CHUNK frames is allocated. If this 
is exceeded while reading the ANIM then a block with space for 
N_FRAMES_PER_CHUNK additional frames is allocated, the previously computed 
frames are copied into this new space, and the old full buffer space is 
deallocated <P>
The tag_AnimFrame  and tag_ANIM structures, defined in 
animutils.h, are used by <CODE>LoadAnim()</CODE>. <P>
