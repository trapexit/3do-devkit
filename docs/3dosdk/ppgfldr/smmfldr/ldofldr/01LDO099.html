<CODE>int32 GetVBLTime (Item ioreq, uint32 *hiorder, uint32 *loworder)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
This function obtains the current value of the system VBL timer and stores the results at *hiorder and *loworder. Either pointer can be NULL. The loworder part of the VBL timer is generally of most interest, it doesn't roll over into the high-order part until roughly 800 days of continuous running without a reboot. <P>
