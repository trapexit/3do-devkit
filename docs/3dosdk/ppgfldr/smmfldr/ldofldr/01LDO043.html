 Creates a cel from scratch.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>CCB * CreateCel (int32 width, int32 height, int32 bitsPerPixel, 
int32 options, void *dataBuf)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Creates a cel of any arbitrary type. The parameters provide just enough 
information to create the basic cel. After the cel is created, you are 
free to modify the CCB. <P>
If you pass a NULL dataBuf pointer, an appropriately-sized buffer is 
allocated when the cel is created. If you pass a non-NULL dataBuf pointer, 
it is stored into the ccb_SourcePtr field instead of allocating a buffer 
internally. <P>
The options parameter is one or more of the following values, ORed 
together as necessary: <P>
CREATECEL_CODED-Create a coded cel. bitsPerPixel must be &lt;= 8. <p>
CREATECEL_UNCODED-Create an uncoded cel. bitsPerPixel must be 8 or 16. <P>
If bitsPerPixel is less than 8, a PLUT is always allocated when the cel is 
created. If bitsPerPixel is 8 or 16, a PLUT is allocated only if the 
CREATECEL_CODED option is set. If a PLUT is allocated all its entries are 
initialized to zero. <P>
The cel is created with a position of 0,0 and size and perspective values 
for a 1:1 mapping. The Preamble Word 1 Blue LSB handling is set to 
PRE1_TLLSB_PDC0. The PIXC word is set for standard opaque, 0x1F001F00. The 
cel flags are set to: CCB_LAST | CCB_NPABS | CCB_SPABS | CCB_PPABS | 
CCB_LDSIZE | CCB_LDPRS | CCB_LDPPMP | CCB_CCBPRE | CCB_YOXY | CCB_USEAV | 
CCB_NOBLK | CCB_ACE | CCB_ACW | CCB_ACCW <P>
Use <CODE>DeleteCel()</CODE> to release all resources allocated for the 
cel. The cel data buffer and PLUT are released only if they were allocated 
by <CODE>CreateCel()</CODE>. If you provided your own dataBuf pointer, you 
must free the buffer yourself. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>width
<DD>Width of the cel, and its data buffer, in pixels. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>height
<DD>Height of the cel, and its data buffer, in pixels. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>bitsPerPixel
<DD>Bits per pixel value for the cel. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>options
<DD>Bitmapped options, as described above. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>dataBuf
<DD>Option data buffer pointer; may be NULL to have a buffer allocated 
automatically. 
</DL>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
Pointer to the new CCB, or NULL if there is not enough memory to make the 
cel. <P>
