 Releases text-related resources, retaining rendered pixels.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>CCB * DetachTextCelCCB (TextCel *tCel)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Releases resources required for rendering new text into a cel, but retains pixels already rendered. In addition to freeing resources, this function removes the reference to the FontDescriptor. You can safely unload a font after calling this function, and still retain text you've already rendered for drawing to the screen later when needed. <P>
Use <CODE>DeleteCel()</CODE> or <CODE>DeleteCelList()</CODE> to dispose of the CCB and cel data buffer when you no longer need them. You cannot use <CODE>DeleteTextCel()</CODE> on the cel after calling this function, since the TextCel structure has been discarded. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>

<DT>tCel
<DD>Pointer to a TextCel structure. 
</DL>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
<DL>
