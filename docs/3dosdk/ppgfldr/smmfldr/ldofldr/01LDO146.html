 Reads a file or a portion of one into memory<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>int ReadFile (char *filename, int32 size, long *buffer, long offset)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
<CODE>ReadFile()</CODE> uses the file system to read a file or a portion of a file into memory. It performs up to four retries on each block read if the filesystem returns an error. <P>
<CODE>ReadFile()</CODE> is useful for loading a portion of a file, optionally starting at some offset into the file. For loading an entire file starting at offset zero, the <CODE>LoadFile()</CODE> function is three to four times faster. <P>
<CODE>ReadFile() </CODE>fills the buffer with size bytes, beginning at offset. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>

</DL>
<DL>
<DT>offset
