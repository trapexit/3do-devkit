 Obtains the current time in hundredths of a second.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>int32 GetHSecTime (Item ioreq)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Obtains the current value of the system microsecond timer, converts the seconds and microseconds into a single hundredths-of-a-second value, and returns the converted value. <P>
The return value will overflow an int32 representation after the machine has been powered on for about 250 days. In other words, this function is probably appropriate for debugging and performance measurement, but may NOT be appropriate for a final application, since some application environments (such as cable TV) are almost certain to run on a machine powered on for months at a time. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>ioreq
<DD>An IOReq item obtained from <CODE>GetTimerIOReq()</CODE>, or zero to have an IOReq dynamically created/deleted during the call. 
</DL>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
Returns positive number of hundredths-of-a-second or a negative error code. <P>
<H3>Implementation</H3>
Library call implemented in lib3do.lib. <P>
