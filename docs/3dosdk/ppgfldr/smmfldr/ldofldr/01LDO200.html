 Suspends a timer.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>Err TimerSuspend (TimerHandle thandle)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Suspends an active timer but does not release resources associated with the timer. If the timer was already suspended this function has no effect. <P>
If an event had occurred for this timer and a notification message was sent, this function withdraws the notification message from your port. If you had already received the message but not yet replied to it, the timer is still properly suspended. In other words, you can respond to a timer event message by suspending the timer that sent the message, and you can safely do so before replying to the message. <P>
Use <CODE>TimerRestart()</CODE> to reactivate the timer using the old time values. Use <CODE>TimerReset()</CODE> to reactivate it using new time values.   If the timer is delay-based, suspending then restarting the timer does not resume the delay count from the point it was suspended, it starts a new delay of the specified period. <P>
