<A NAME="XREF31940"><H1>TimerSignalHeartbeatVBL </A></H1>
 Sends a signal periodically based on VBLs.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>TimerHandle TimerSignalHeartbeatVBL (int32 signal, uint32 fields)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Creates a timer that repeatedly notifies you by signal after the specified number of VBLs have occurred. The timer continues sending notifications on a regular interval until you use <CODE>TimerSuspend()</CODE> to temporarily halt it or <CODE>TimerCancel()</CODE> to delete it. <P>
The Heartbeat support in the TimerServices thread contains logic to prevent drift in the frequency of timer events. Signals are delivered at the specified frequency even if it takes you significant time to respond to each signal event. <P>
The TimerServices thread must be active before calling this function. <P>
