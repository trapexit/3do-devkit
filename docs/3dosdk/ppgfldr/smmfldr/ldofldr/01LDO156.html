 Sets background and foreground colors for a cel.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>void SetTextCelColors (TextCel *tCel, int32 bgColor,int32 fgColors[4])</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Sets the background and foreground colors to use when the cel is drawn. This Function sets all four foreground colors; use it with features that allow multiple text colors within a single cel. Because of special internal logic that calculates scaled colors for anti-aliasing, you must use this function to change the colors, rather than manipulating the cel's PLUT directly. After you use this call to change the colors, the next <CODE>DrawCels()</CODE> call renders the contents already in the cel in new colors. <P>
Colors follow the usual rules for 3DO cels. The bgColor and fgColor values are interpreted as RGB555 values. A color of 0,0,0 is transparent. To get opaque black, use MakeRGB15(0,0,1). If bgColor or any of the fgColors are passed as -1L, the corresponding values in the text cel remain unchanged. <P>
When created, a TextCel has default colors of transparent for background, pure white for foreground pen 0, and no color (transparent) for foreground pens 1-3. <P>
