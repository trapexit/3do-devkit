<A NAME="XREF12893"><H1>CloneTextCel </A></H1>
 Clones an existing text cel.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>TextCel * CloneTextCel (TextCel *templateTextCel, Boolean clonePixels)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Creates a new TextCel using a TextCel that already exists as a template. If clonePixels is FALSE, the new TextCel contains no text; if TRUE, the pixels from the template TextCel are copied into the new TextCel. <P>
If the template cel has a format buffer attached to it, and that buffer was dynamically allocated by the call to <CODE>SetTextCelFormatBuffer()</CODE>, a new buffer of the same size is allocated and attached to the new cel. If the template cel has a format buffer that you provided explicitly (a static buffer), the new cel will use the same static buffer. <P>
This function is useful when you want to create a number of identical TextCels. You can call <CODE>CreateTextCel()</CODE>, followed by whatever <CODE>SetTextCel...()</CODE> functions you need to create a template cel with a given size and attributes, then call <CODE>CloneTextCel()</CODE> as often as necessary to create a number of cels with identical size and attributes. <P>
Use <CODE>DeleteTextCel()</CODE> to dispose of the TextCel when you are finished with it. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>templateTextCel
<DD>Pointer to the TextCel structure you want to clone. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>clonePixels
<DD>TRUE if the new TextCel is to contain the same pixels as those currently in the template TextCel. 
</DL>
<H3>Return Value</H3>
Pointer to the newly created TextCel structure; NULL if there isn't enough memory to create the new TextCel. <P>
