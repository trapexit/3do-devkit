 Maps a list of cels to a quad.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>void MapCelListToCQuad (CCB *list, CQuad *quad)</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
This function maps a list of cels to the specified quad. It is much 
faster than a standard <CODE>MapCel()</CODE> call because it only has to 
calculate a simple rectangular projection. It performs a 
<CODE>MapCelToCQuad()</CODE> on the first cel in the list. It then adjusts 
the X/Y coordinates of the rest of the cels in the list such that all the 
cels maintain the same relative X/Y relationships to each other. It also 
copies the size and perspective fields from the first cel into all the 
rest of the cels in the list. The net effect is that the list of cels 
moves and scales as if it were a single unit. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>

<DT>list
<DD>Pointer to a list of one or more cels to be mapped. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>quad
<DD>Pointer to the CQuad to which the cels are to be mapped.
