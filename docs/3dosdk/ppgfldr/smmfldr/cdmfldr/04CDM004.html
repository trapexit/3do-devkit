When you're satisfied that your title on the CD-ROM disc is completely 
functional in stand-alone mode, you can create the HFS-formatted discs to 
send to 3DO Developer Services for encryption. <P>
To create the final master CD-ROM in HFS format, follow these steps: <P>

<LI>Place the CD-ROM in the disc recorder's drive. Two lights should be

disc and drag it on top of the Apple HFS icon on your desktop.

<p>
<LI>Click on the Make button.
<p>
<p>The partition is recorded to disc.
<p>
<p>The QuickTOPiX status window appears and reports the progress of the 
mastering process. The transfer rate should be between 295 KB/s and 300 
KB/s. When the process is finished, "Ready" appears in the status window. 
<P>
<p><B>Caution: </B>Do not open the drawer too soon. The Writing light turns 
off once, then turns on as the lead data is written. <P>

<LI>Remove the new master disc, label it with date and contents, and mark 
it HFS formatted. 
<p>
<LI>Test the master disc on your 3DO Testing Station before sending it off 
to the 3DO Company.
