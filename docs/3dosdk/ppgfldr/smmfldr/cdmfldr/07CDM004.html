<H1>Optimization Issues</H1>

To minimize startup time and file access time, consider the following 
issues: 
<UL>
<LI> A title that uses the optimized layout procedure described in this 
document usually has better file access time than a title that uses the 
simple layout only. An exception may be a title using custom layout 
fine-tuned by the developer. 
<li> If you use the optimized layout procedure described in this 
document, it is critical that the person collecting access information is 
thoroughly familiar with the title. 
<li> Catapult is a relatively new feature to speed up startup time. Since 
the effect of Catapult depends on the title in question, consider 
preparing one image using Catapult, one without, and comparing the two.
