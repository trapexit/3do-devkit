Because the compact disc recorder has very little buffering, your Macintosh must maintain a continuous 300 KB/s data stream to it during recording. Therefore, prepare your Macintosh as follows: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Disconnect the Macintosh from any networks and shut down all network drivers. 
<p>
<LI>Remove system extensions that attempt to monitor SCSI bus activity, such as those that implement flashing menu bar icons to show disk activity.
<p>
<LI>Keep the compact disc recorder in a stable environment, in particular: 
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Make sure there is no movement near the recorder; it can cause a faulty CD-ROM disc. 
<p>
<LI>Don't place the Macintosh hard drive on top of the recorder or near loudspeakers.

<A NAME="XREF34445"><H2>Setting Up the QuickTOPiX Software</A></H2>
The QuickTOPiX software lets you master a CD-ROM disc in several different 
formats, two of which you use during the mastering process: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Choosing Block Image creates a disc in 3DO format for testing.
<p>
<LI>Choosing Apple HFS image creates an HFS disc for delivery to the 3DO Company for encryption.
</UL>
This section discusses setting up the software for both image formats and lists the files created during that process.<P>
<B>Note: </B>Setting up the software for both image formats before starting the mastering process saves time and trouble later. <P>
