Images, animations, and sounds exist in a host of different file formats. The formats listed in this appendix are those commonly used for storage on 3DO CD-ROM discs, within the system itself, and for art and music development on a 3DO development system. Most of these formats are existing standards maintained by outside organizations. You'll find their specifications in documents published by those organizations or in file format standards books. File formats created and maintained by the 3DO Company are listed here with their specifications.<P>
