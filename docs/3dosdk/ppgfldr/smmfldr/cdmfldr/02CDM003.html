<H1>Checking for Low Memory Pointers<LINK NAME="XREF33590"></LINK></H1><HR>
Several titles submitted to The 3DO Company for encryption were accessing 
the lower 512 bytes of memory, which are reserved for the operating 
system. This often involved using the return value of a system or user 
function as the base address for a structure without checking whether that 
value was NULL.<P>
To solve this problem, The 3DO Company offered each developer a hardware 
upgrade to the 3DO development system that facilitates easy detection of 
low memory pointers in 1994. <P>
<H2>Why Avoiding Low Memory Access is Important</H2>
Even if a title that accesses low memory runs without errors on the 
current 3DO player, is not guaranteed to work on future hardware for two 
reasons:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Different manufacturers' hardware returns different values when low 
memory is accessed. 
<LI>Future hardware or operating systems may not allow low memory access 
at all.
</UL>
<B>Warning: </B>Titles must be low memory clean to receive a Right to 
Manufacture.<P>
<H2>How to Detect and Remove Low Memory Pointers</H2>
To detect and remove low memory pointers, you need the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI>A version of your application. You can work with a development 
version, a <I>cdrom.image</I> file, or a CD-ROM.
<p>
<LI>The symbols file for your program. You need this file to identify 
where low memory pointers are used in your source code. 
<p>
<LI>The 3DO Debugger 1.9b5 or later.
<p>
<LI>The 3DO operating system 1.3.1 or later. 
</UL>
With all required files available, go through the following steps: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Run your application from the Debugger on a 3DO development system 
that has a low memory detection board. 
<p>
<p>If you're not sure whether your Station has a low memory detection 
board, run the example code in "<A HREF="#XREF11961">Checking for Low 
Memory Boards</A>" below.
<p>

<LI>Make sure the following windows are open:

<p>
<UL>
<LI>Terminal window
<LI>Disassembly window
<LI>Register window
<LI>Source window
</UL>
<p>
<LI>If you can test all parts of your application without problems, no 
additional action is necessary. 
<p>
<LI>If the program accesses low memory, it aborts where the access occurs 
displaying the following message: 
<p>
<DL>
<DD><CODE>3DO Debug : Abort (Dat) = PC@address</CODE><BR>
</DL>
<p>
<p>
<p><CODE>address</CODE> is the point in the program where the problem 
occurred. 
<p>
<p>
<LI>If you look at the Disassembly window and the Register window, you are 
likely to find that the program stopped when accessing an address lower 
than 00x1FF. 
<p>
<LI>If you look at the Source window, you are likely to find an error 
return value.
<p>
<p>In most cases, you have to modify your source code to check for NULL. 
<p>

<LI>Note the problem location for later correction.
<p>
<LI>Try to continue from the Debugger, repeating the process until you 
have found all instances of low memory access. In some cases, for example, 
if the access happens during a loop, you may have to fix one problem and 
recompile your application before you can continue. 
</OL>
<A NAME="XREF11961"><H3>Checking for Low Memory Boards</A></H3>
If you're not sure whether your 3DO Station has a low memory board 
installed, compile and link the following program, then run it on the 3DO 
Station. This program stops, as explained above. <P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
int main()
{
    int *addr=0;
    int i;
    
    i = *addr;
}
</CODE>
