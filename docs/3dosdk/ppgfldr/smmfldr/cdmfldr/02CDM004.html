<H1>Testing Your Title in the Minimum Memory Configuration</A>
</UL></H1><HR>
This section discusses the minimum available memory and explains how to 
test your application with the <CODE>minmem</CODE> utility. <P>
When you send in your title for encryption, 3DO Developer Services tests 
it in both the minimum memory environment and the nonrestricted, full 
memory environment. If your title does not run in both environments, 3DO 
Developer Services cannot accept it. <P>
The following sections provide information about the minmem utility, 
including: <P>

<A NAME="XREF38182"><H2>What is minmem?</A></H2>
The minmem utility lets you test your title in the minimum memory 
configuration. By specification, any 3DO hardware, regardless of which 
manufacturer produced it, has to supply at least as much memory. <P>
You are encouraged to write your title so it runs in the minimum memory 
environment but can take advantage of more memory if it becomes available 
in future versions of the 3DO system. <P>
The development environment shell provides the minmem program. If you run 
minmem before you run your title, the system frees 45 * 32 KB DRAM and 63 
* 16 KB VRAM for the application to use.<P>
<B>Note: </B>The actual space available in the minimum memory 
configuration changes slightly with each release of the operating system. 
The numbers above are the minimum that's guaranteed to be available.<P>
<A NAME="XREF41768"><H2>When and Why to Test Your Application with 
minmem</A></H2>
You must test your title in the minimum memory configuration at three 
points during the mastering process: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Before creating the CD-ROM image file
<LI>After creating the CD-ROM image file
<LI>After mastering the disc 
</UL>
Testing your title in the minimum memory configuration is important 
because otherwise it may not run on future versions of 3DO hardware. <P>
<B>Warning: </B>If your title doesn't run in the minimum memory 
configuration, 3DO Developer Services cannot issue a Right to 
Manufacture.<P>
<A NAME="XREF17467"><H2>How to Use minmem</A></H2>
You can run <CODE>minmem</CODE> in one of two ways: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Type <CODE>minmem</CODE> at the Debugger prompt after running the 3DO 
boot script, but before launching your title. 
<p>
<LI>Check to make sure <CODE>minmem</CODE> is included at the end of the 
<I>AppStartup</I> script file during testing. 
</UL>
<B>Caution: </B>Starting with the Portfolio 1.3.1 release (May 1994) the 
AppStartup script in the /cdrommaster folder includes minmem. If your 
title has a mechanism to take advantage of additional memory if it becomes 
available, you are responsible for removing the minmem command just before 
your final layout of the cdrom.image file. <P>
