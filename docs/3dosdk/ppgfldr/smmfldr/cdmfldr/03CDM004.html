Preparing an optimized CD-ROM image starts with creating a basic image, 
described in <A HREF="./03CDM003.html#XREF29116">Preparing Simple 
cdrom.image Files</A>. The following sections discuss the additional steps 
needed to produce an optimized image, which include:<P>

discussed above with the exception of the label field, which should be set 
to remote. To create the base image, follow these steps: <P>

<LI>Edit the cdrom.tcl file using the settings in <A

The optimizing layout tool requires information about when and how often 
the different files your title consists of are accessed when someone uses 
the title. <P>
To set up the Debugger to collect file access information, follow these

<LI>Make sure that RAM is set to Standard
<LI>Check the Set Initial Breakpoints 
<LI>Check Set CD Emulation
<LI>Uncheck Auto-Launch Script
<LI>Uncheck Serial Port Enable

your current data directory to the location of the <I>cdrom.image</I>

select the boot script.

<p>Since you have turned on Set Initial Breakpoints, the application

<A NAME="XREF34748"><H2>Running the Layout Tool to Create an Optimized 
Image</A></H2>
To create an optimized CD-ROM image file, you have to make the CD access 
log available to the <I>cdrom.tcl</I> script file that you run to create a 
CD-ROM image. <P>
This section shows how to set up all required files and how to run the 
layout tool again to create the optimized image.<P>
<A NAME="XREF12580"><H3>Editing the cdrom.tcl File for the Optimized 
Image</A></H3>
To edit the <I>cdrom.tcl</I> file for the optimized image, use the 
settings in the table below, which differ from the settings for the 
nonoptimized image you used earlier:<P>
<PRE>
<B>Table 1: </B><I> Variable settings for optimized image creation.</I>
--------------------------------------------------------
Variable  |Setting                                      
--------------------------------------------------------
label     |cd-rom (the default). Make sure the label is 
          |NOT set to remote at this stage or you won't 
          |be able to debug the optimized image.        
--------------------------------------------------------
megabytes |Number of megabytes of CD-ROM space your     
          |software will occupy. Larger is better; the  
          |more storage space you allocate (in excess of
          |the amount actually needed for one copy of   
          |each file), the more room the optimizer and  
          |Catapult have to make multiple avatars of    
          |your title's files, and the more effective   
          |the optimization and clustering will be.     
--------------------------------------------------------
catapultme|Set catapultmegabytes to the number of       
gabytes   |megabytes of CD-ROM space that you wish to   
          |make available for the Catapult file. If your
          |application already uses most of the space on
          |the CD-ROM, you can make this a fairly small 
          |number (Catapult files as small as 4 or 5 MB 
          |can make a big difference in startup speed). 
          |If your application has lots of room to      
          |spare, request a larger Catapult file (20 to 
          |30 MB or more).
          |
          |Since the actual benefit of Catapult varies 
          |greatly depending  on the title, consider 
          |making several images, one of them with 
          |catapultmegabytes commented out.                                      
--------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>
<P>
If you used Catapult, you can exclude certain files or entire directories, from being included 
in the Catapult file (see <A 
HREF="./03CDM001.html#XREF41440">Catapult</A>). This can make sense for 
Cinepak or other full-motion-video files: they take up a lot of space in 
the Catapult file and usually don't benefit much from being catapulted. To 
do this, include a statement using one of the following formats in your 
<I>cdrom.tcl</I> file: <P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
excludecatapult "foo/bar/baz.cinepak" 
excludecatapult "foo/bar/"
</CODE>
</PRE>
The <CODE>excludecatapult</CODE> command accepts a single parameter, the 
Portfolio pathname to a file or directory. In either case, the path is 
relative to the root directory of the file system being created. The first 
format identifies a specific file which is to be excluded from the 
Catapult file. The second format (with a trailing "/") identifies a 
directory, and specifies that all files found in that directory are to be 
excluded from the Catapult file. <P>
<H3>Dealing with Large Files</H3>
If you have a large Cinepak file, or any other large file which is 
"streamed" into memory at high speed, you should do one of two things: <P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Either</I> exclude the file from the Catapult file using the 
<CODE>excludecatapult</CODE> command
<LI><I>or</I> make sure that the entire file is included in the Catapult 
file. 
</UL>
You need to make sure you don't have half of a file in the Catapult file 
and half of it excluded. This can occur if during your test-and-exercise 
run you play halfway through the file and then use the control pad to skip 
the rest of the introductory sequence. In this case, there may be an extra 
seek when the catapulted CD-ROM image accesses the file. It reads the 
first portion of the data from the Catapult file, but is forced to find an 
avatar of the file itself to get the remainder. <P>
<H3>Starting the Image Creation Process</H3>
After you've run the title with CD Access Log on, you should find a 
<I>filemap.out</I> file and a <I>CD_Access.log</I> file in the 
<I>/cdrommaster/_version</I> folder. <P>
<OL>
<LI>Rename the <I>filemap.out</I> file to <I>filemap.in</I>.
<p>
<LI>Make sure the <I>CD_Access.log</I> file resides in the 
<I>/cdrommaster/_version </I>folder.
<p>
<LI>Delete (or rename and move) the old copy of the <I>cdrom.image</I> 
file in the 
<I>/cdrommaster/_version</I> folder.
<p>
<LI>Run the layout tool program again, using the newly edited script. The 
<I>CD.Access.log</I> and <I>filemap.in</I> files are automatically used as 
input. 
<p>
<p>The tool goes through several stages of file access analysis: 
clustering, file organization, cluster placement, and avatar assignment. 
It then writes a new <I>cdrom.image</I> file, which is optimized for the 
access performed while testing the first <I>cdrom.image </I>file.
