Stations</LINK></H1><HR>
To test your disc properly after mastering, you need one 3DO Testing 
Station for each type of 3DO hardware. For an up-to-date list of testing 
stations, contact your account representative. <P>
The 3DO Testing Station is a version of the 3DO Interactive 
Multiplayer system that has been modified to allow you to switch 
between encrypted and unencrypted CD-ROMs. This allows you to test both 
encrypted discs and unencrypted discs on the same player.<P>
