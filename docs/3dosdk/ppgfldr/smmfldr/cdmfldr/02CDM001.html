This section helps you work with application size limitations, discussing

CD-ROM discs can hold up to 640 MB of information, which must include:<P>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>The title's program and art files
<LI>System files
<LI>CD-ROM access information generated during the CD layout process
</UL><BR>
<p>
In most cases, your title can use approximately 600 MB on the disc. The 
exact portion of the 640 MB for your application data is variable and 
depends in part on these factors:<P>
<UL>
<LI>How much space on the disc does the system require?
<p>
<LI>How large are the individual developer files?
<p>
<LI>How many avatars (instances) of the root, label, and directory files 
does the layout tool place on the disc?
<p>
<LI>Default numbers are: 3 directory avatars, 7 root avatars, and 2 label 
avatars. The <I>cdrom.tcl</I> file contains information on how to safely 
change the defaults. 
</UL>
<A NAME="XREF41706"><H2>Determining Available Space for Your 
Application</A></H2>
The only reliable way to determine exactly how large an application can 
fit on the disc is to run through the normal layout procedure described 
briefly below and in detail in the <A 
HREF="./03CDM003.html#XREF29116">Preparing Simple cdrom.image 
Files</A>: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Place the executable and data files in the <I>/cdrommaster/takeme</I> 
folder 
<p>
<LI>Set the <I>cdrom.image</I> file size in the <I>cdrom.tcl </I>file to 
640 
<p>
<LI>Run the layout tool
</OL>
You can include the maximum amount of data when, in the <I>cdrom.tcl 
</I>file, image file size is set to 640 and the number of directory, root, 
and label avatars are all set to two. If you do this and the layout tool 
produces the error "Could not assign avatars for ...," you need to reduce 
your title's content. <P>
