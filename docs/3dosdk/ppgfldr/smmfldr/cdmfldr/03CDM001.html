This section is an overview of how to create a <I>cdrom.image</I> file of 
your title using the layout tool optimized for clustering and the Catapult 
file for rapid startup.<P>

<H2>Layout Tool Background Information</H2>
The layout tool, which is provided on the 3DO Portfolio CD-ROM, takes all 
files in a folder and creates one CD-ROM image file. In the process, it 
places one or more avatars (instances) of the root, label, and directory 
in the image. <P>
The current version of the layout tool allows optimized layout. First you 
collect information about your title using a simple image, then the layout 
tool uses that information for layout. The current layout tool also 
contains the Catapult feature which enables your CD-ROM to be started up 
much more quickly than was possible in earlier releases.<P>
<H3>Nonoptimized Layout</H3>
The original layout uses a "first seen, first placed" algorithm. Files are 
"seen" in alphabetical order within each directory; subdirectories are 
seen and placed recursively as they're encountered.<P>
This algorithm leads to delays during certain stages of a title's startup. 
For example, a program's sound (<I>.aiff</I>) files frequently require the 
loading of a DSP instrument (<I>.dsp</I>) template file. Because the 
<I>.aiff</I> and <I>.dsp</I> files are stored in different directories, 
they're a fair distance apart on the CD-ROM, and the drive spends a lot of 
time moving the read head back and forth between different areas of the 
disc.<P>
<H3>Layout Using the Cluster Optimizer</H3>
The current layout tool with its cluster optimizer locates files in 
clusters according to when they are used, not according to their position 
in the file system. If files from different directories are accessed one 
right after the other, they usually end up in adjacent sections of the 
CD-ROM. This greatly reduces head-seek time. Since files that are accessed 
in sequential time order are often laid out in sequential physical 
position, several files can be read in sequence with only one head seek.<P>
The optimizer also places additional avatars (copies) of 
frequently-accessed files in several different locations on the disc. 
Small, frequently used files may be replicated up to 7 times). Large or 
infrequently used files may not be replicated at all. <P>
The amount of avatar duplication depends on the amount of otherwise unused 
space in your file system. If your title has so much data that it almost 
fills a 640 MB CD-ROM, very little space is available for cluster 
optimization and avatar duplication. If your application uses only a few 
hundred megabytes, there is plenty of room for avatar duplication. This 
can improve performance. It also enables your application to run even if 
one or more avatar of critical files is not available because of 
scratching or other damage to the CD-ROM.<P>
The clustering optimizer has some significant limitations. It is fairly 
common for an application to read pieces out of several different files in 
alternation. For example, when opening an audio <I>.aiff</I> file, the 
audio folio usually reads the first block of the <I>.aiff</I> file, then 
opens and reads the contents of a <I>.dsp</I> instrument file the 
<I>.aiff</I> file points to, and then reads the remainder of the 
<I>.aiff</I> file. The cluster optimizer can reduce the cost of the head 
seeks that take place when the drive seeks back and forth between the 
<I>.aiff</I> and <I>.dsp</I> files, but it cannot eliminate them. A 
similar problem arises whenever a program reads data from two or more 
files in parallel. <P>
A further limitation of the clustering optimizer involves directories. 
Directories cannot actually be placed within clusters, because the size of 
a directory cannot be determined accurately until the placement (and 
number of avatars) of every file within that directory have been 
finalized. During a cluster optimization, directories are placed in small 
gaps between clusters. Accessing a directory at runtime (if the 
directory's contents are not currently in the directory cache) usually 
requires two head-seeks: one to the directory and one to the file that has 
just been opened. Clustering can reduce the cost of these 
directory-related seeks, but cannot eliminate them.<P>
<A NAME="XREF41440"><H3>Catapult</A></H3>
Catapult is a feature recently added to the optimized layout tool. With 
the Catapult feature, the layout tool collects the CD-ROM data that your 
application needs at startup time (programs, data files, folios, 
directories, etc.) into a single area of the disc, in exactly the order 
needed. As a result, the startup process requires very few head-seeks. 
Proper Catapult optimization of your title can reduce its startup time 
significantly.<P>
Catapult's operation takes place at the file system/driver interface. 
Since you can use Catapult without making any changes to your programs or 
data, you should prepare one optimized image using Catapult, one 
optimized image without Catapult, and complare. The actual speedup varies 
greatly depending on the title itself. 
level.<P>
<H2>Optimized Layout Process Overview</H2>
To use the clustering optimizer, you must perform the layout process twice 
and collect access information in between. This results in the following 
steps, which are described in the remainder of this chapter:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Perform your first layout process which results in a simple, 
nonoptimized <I>cdrom.image</I> file. 
<p>
<LI>Test your title. 
<p>
<LI>Create the base image for optimized layout. Use this image to exercise 
your title and collect access information using the 3DO Debugger's ability 
to create a <I>CD_Access.log</I> file which records all of the reads 
issued to the <I>cdrom.image</I> file during testing.
<p>
<LI>Perform a second layout process during which the layout tool uses 
information from the <I>CD_Access.log</I> file to group files into 
clusters based on the actual patterns of use. This optimized 
<I>cdrom.image</I> file can then be burned onto a CD-ROM disc and tested.
