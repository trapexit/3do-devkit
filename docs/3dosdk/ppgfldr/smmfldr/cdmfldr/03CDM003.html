<TITLE>Preparing Simple cdrom.image Files</TITLE>
<H1><A NAME="XREF29116">Preparing Simple cdrom.image Files</A></H1>
The first step in creating your CD-ROM is to generate a simple, 
nonoptimized <I>cdrom.image</I> file. You create the CD-ROM image file 
using the <CODE>laytool</CODE> program. This program uses a 
<I>cdrom.tcl</I> script file to create the image file. This section 
describes: <P>

Image</A>
<LI><A HREF="#XREF13372">Creating the Simple Image</A>
</UL>
All files and folders needed to create the image file are in the 
/<I>cdrommaster </I>folder named after the current version of the 
operating system.<P>
To step through this section, you should have already set up your files, 
as explained in <A HREF="./03CDM002.html#XREF34059">Preparing Your Title's 
Files for the Layout Process</A>.<P>
<H3>About the cdrom.tcl File</H3>
The <I>cdrom.tcl</I> script file contains variables that affect the final 
form of the CD-ROM image file. Variables are defined with <CODE>set</CODE> 
commands in the script. If a command is preceded by an initial hash sign 
(#), it is considered a comment and won't execute. <P>
<A NAME="XREF29196"><H2>Editing the cdrom.tcl File for the Simple 
Image</A></H2>
To edit the <I>cdrom.tcl</I> file for first-time layout, follow these 
steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Launch MPW.
<p>
<LI>From the Directory menu, choose Set Directory and select the folder 
inside the <I>cdrommaster</I> folder that is named like the most recent 
operating system.
<p>
<LI>From the File menu, choose Open and select the <I>cdrom.tcl</I> file. 
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B>The cdrom.tcl file is commented extensively; if you pay 
attention to the comments, you should find editing the file quite easy.<BR>
<p>

<LI>Edit the file so the variables have the values shown in the table 
below:

<B>Table 1: </B><I> Variable settings for simple image creation.</I>
--------------------------------------------------------
Variable      |Setting                                  
--------------------------------------------------------
imagefile     |Pathname of a cdrom.image file to be     
              |created on a hard disk that has at least 
              |640 MB space.                            
--------------------------------------------------------
label         |Set to "cd-rom" during initial testing of
              |the CD-ROM image.                        
--------------------------------------------------------
takedirectory |Pathname of the /takeme folder that      
              |contains the title.                      
--------------------------------------------------------
megabytes     |Rule of Thumb: Use 110% of the size of   
              |the /takeme folder (with your executable 
              |and data files), and use that number as  
              |the number of megabytes. If you allocate 
              |too little, the layout process           
              |terminates. If you allocate too much, the
              |process takes longer but there won't be  
              |other problems. The number of blocks must
              |be a multiple of 16.The number of        
              |kilobytes must be a multiple of 32.      
--------------------------------------------------------
directoryavata|The number of directory avatars defaults 
rs            |to 3 and may be safely reduced to 2.     
--------------------------------------------------------
rootavatars   |The number of root avatars defaults to 7 
              |and may be safely reduced to 2.          
--------------------------------------------------------
labelavatars  |The number of label avatars defaults to  
              |2, and must not be changed.              
--------------------------------------------------------

The different avatars are discussed in some detail in the <I>cdrom.tcl</I> 
file itself. <P>
<A NAME="XREF13372"><H2>Creating the Simple Image</A></H2>
To create a CD-ROM image using the layout tool, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>In the MPW Worksheet window, make sure<I> /cdrommaster/_version_</I> 
is the working directory.
<p>
<p>The<I> /cdrommaster/_version_</I> folder contains the <I>/takeme</I> 
folder with your executables and data. 
<p>

<LI>Type <CODE>laytool &lt; cdrom.tcl</CODE> and press the Enter key (not 
the Return key). 
<p>
<p>After you've started the image creation process, the layout tool does the 
following:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Assembles the Macintosh file hierarchy of your title into a Portfolio 
file system. 
<p>
<LI>Creates the <I>cdrom.image</I> file. 
<p>
<LI>Creates the <I>filemap.out</I> file that is needed for creating an 
optimized CD-ROM image. 
</UL>
<p>
<p>At the end of the process, the MPW shell should display the line "layout 
successful."<P>
<p>If you don't see the line "layout successful," or if something else goes 
wrong: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Look at <A HREF="./03CDM006.html#XREF35577">Layout Tool 
Troubleshooting</A> below. 
<p>
<LI>If you can't solve your problems with that information, select the 
status messages the layout tool printed and save them to a file for use by 
3DO Developer Technical Support. 
</UL>
</OL>
<H2>Testing the Simple Image</H2>
To test the CD-ROM image file, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Rename any additional copies of your title's executable and data 
folders you have on your Macintosh so they aren't accessed instead of the 
files in the CD-ROM image you want to test. 
<p>

<LI>Make sure there are no other <I>cdrom.image </I>files anywhere on your 
Macintosh.
<p>
<LI>Make sure your environment is set up for debugging. 
<p>
<LI>Open the Debugger and select Cancel when prompted for a script to 
execute. 
<p>
<LI>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences and make sure the CD Emulation 
checkbox is checked. 
<p>
<LI>From the File menu, choose Directories, and then choose Setup. In the 
dialog that appears, click Data, then find the <I>cdrom.image</I> file you 
just created and click Select Current Directory.
<p>
<LI>From the Target menu, select Launch.
<p>
<LI>When prompted, select the boot script and click Execute.
<p>
<LI>Press Command-G to start the operating system (if you didn't uncheck 
Set Initial Breakpoints).
<p>
<LI>When you see a Mac-&gt; prompt in the Debugger Terminal window, type 
the following:
<p>
<DL>
<DD><CODE>alias boot /cd-rom</CODE><BR>
</DL>
<p>
<p>This sets the alias <CODE>boot</CODE> to <CODE>/cd-rom</CODE>. In 
turn, any pathname in the application that contains <CODE>$boot</CODE> 
will properly reference the files on the CD-ROM.
<p>

<LI>Execute the program contained in the image file by typing the 
following command into the Terminal window:
<p>
<DL>
<DD><CODE>$boot/launchme</CODE><BR>
</DL>
<p>
<p>The Debugger runs your title from the image file and you can perform 
the first round of testing.
