You have to test your title on the CD-ROM in two ways, discussed in this 
section:<P>

Configuration</A>.

This in effect simulates the end-user playing the title, as discussed in 
the next section.

Testing the CD-ROM involves two steps, which are discussed in the next two 
sections: <P>

<B>Note: </B>Be sure to perform all tests on a Station with a low memory

To run your title from a CD-ROM using the Debugger, do the following to 
set up your environment: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Delete or rename any cdrom.image files on your Macintosh.
<P>
<LI>Move or rename any executable or data files in /remote.
<P>
<LI>Since the title resides on an unencrypted CD-ROM, set up the hardware 
as follows:

<p><B>Note: </B>If you test your CD-ROM from the Debugger, 
<CODE>printf()</CODE> statements in the program are displayed in the 
Terminal window on the Macintosh. This helps you debug your title.<P>
<A NAME="XREF12437"><H3>Running the CD-ROM in the Minimum Memory 
Configuration</A></H3>

To run your title from the CD-ROM disc in the minimum memory 
configuration, follow these steps: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Insert the Master CD-ROM into the tray on the 3DO Development Station 
(or the CD-ROM drive attached to the 3DO Development Card).
<p>
<LI>Launch the 3DO Debugger on the Macintosh (or select Hardware Reset 
from the Execution menu if the Debugger is already running).
<p>
<LI>Execute the boot script.   
<p>
<LI>Press Command-G to start the operating system.
<p>
<LI>When you see the Mac-&gt; prompt in the Debugger Terminal window, type:
<p>
<CODE><DL>
<DD><CODE>minmem</CODE> </CODE><BR>
</DL>
<p>
<LI>To set the alias<CODE> boot</CODE> to /cd-rom, type:
<p>
<DL>
<DD><CODE>alias boot /cd-rom</CODE><BR>
</DL>
<p>
<LI>To run your title from the CD-ROM, type:

<H2>Debugging Hints</H2>
This section discusses what you can do if you have problems running your 
title from the newly mastered CD-ROM disc: <P>

<LI><A HREF="#XREF23074">Stepping Through the Title on the CD-ROM Disc</A> 
<LI><A HREF="#XREF32919">Pulling Files Off the CD-ROM</A>
</UL>
<A NAME="XREF23074"><H3>Stepping Through the Title on the CD-ROM 
Disc</A></H3>
If a Symbols file for the title is still available in the /remote 
directory, you can step through the title on your CD-ROM disc using the 
Debugger. <P>
The <I>3DO Debugger Programmer's Guide </I>describes this process in more 
detail.<P>
<A NAME="XREF32919"><H3>Pulling Files Off the CD-ROM</A></H3>
If you are unsure which version of your executable you have placed on the 
disc, or if you need to pull files off the CD-ROM for some other reason, 
use the <CODE>copy2mac</CODE> utility to copy files from the CD to your 
Macintosh.<P>
<B>Note: </B>The copy2mac utility does not accept filenames with spaces. 
<P>
You can pull individual files from the CD-ROM disc and place them on your 
Macintosh for inspection by typing the following at the Terminal window:<P>
<DL>
<DD><CODE>copy2mac &lt;source&gt; &lt;destination&gt;</CODE><BR>
</DL>
For example, to place the file myfile in the /temp folder on the volume 
TheMaster, type the following:<P>
<DL>
<DD><CODE>copy2mac /cd-rom/myfile TheMaster:temp:myfile</CODE><BR>
</DL>
<B>Note: </B>The source filename has a leading slash (/); the destination 
filename does not unless you specify a file inside /remote<P>
<A NAME="XREF34334"><H2>Testing the CD-ROM Disc on a Testing 
Station</A></H2>
If your title has executed successfully under the minimum memory 
configuration, on a 3DO Station with a low memory detection board, you 
should test it on a testing station. Running the title on a testing 
station simulates what the end-user will experience on a 3DO Interactive 
Multiplayer system. <P>
The 3DO Testing Station is a version of the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer 
system that has been modified so you can switch between encrypted and 
unencrypted CD-ROMs. This allows you to play both encrypted discs and 
unencrypted discs on the same station.<P>
The only external difference to the Interactive Multiplayer is the ROM 
switch located at the rear of the player. In the DOWN position, the player 
reads and plays unencrypted discs. In the UP position, it reads and plays 
encrypted discs.<P>
