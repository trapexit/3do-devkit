<H1>Layout Tool Troubleshooting<LINK NAME="XREF25054"></LINK></H1><HR>
This section explains some of the error messages or problems you can 
encounter while running the layout tool and provides possible solutions.<P>
<H3>Error Message: Layout failed; unable to allocate avatar(s)</H3>
The placement of avatars can result in insufficient contiguous space for a 
large file and result in following message:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
layout failed: unable to allocate avatar(s) 
for:MyReallyBigMovieFile
</CODE>
</PRE>
If that message appears, increase the total amount of space assigned to 
the image file or reduce the number of avatars.<P>
<H3>Error Message: CD Image creation error: "Could not assign avatar(s) 
for launchme"</H3>
This message indicates the layout tool could not write all the avatars 
because the <I>cdrom.tcl</I> file did not allocate enough space for the 
image. Try the following:<P>
<OL>
<LI>In the <I>cdrom.tcl</I> file, increase the amount of space allocated 
for the <I>cdrom.image</I> file by editing the following line:
<p>
<DL>
<DD><CODE>set megabytes n</CODE><BR>
</DL>
<DL>
<DD><CODE>((size of takeme folder) * 1.1) </CODE><BR>
</DL>
<p>

<LI>Decrease the number of directory avatars or root avatars in the<I> 
cdrom.tcl</I> file.
</OL>
<H3>Error Message: CD Image creation error: "Unable to match glob 
patterns"</H3>
There is an empty folder in the directory you created; remove it. <P>
<H3>Problem: Title does not run</H3>
To track down the problem, ask yourself the following questions: <P>
<UL>
<p>
<LI>Are there hard-coded pathnames using <I>/remote</I> in your program? 
Your program must use aliases to <CODE>$boot</CODE>, which the system sets 
to <I>/remote</I> when running through the Debugger, and to <I>/cd-rom</I> 
when running from the CD-ROM image or disc.
<p>
<LI>When testing in Debugger mode, make sure to set the <CODE>$boot</CODE> 
alias to 
<CODE>/cd-rom</CODE> before running your application. On the command line 
in the Debugger, type the following:
</UL>
<DL>
<DD><CODE>alias boot /cd-rom</CODE><BR>
</DL>
<UL>
<LI>Then run <I>launchme</I>.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>Make sure that you use the version of the layout tool distributed with 
the most recent release of 3DO software.
<p>
<LI>When your application reads files from the CD-ROM, it must read an 
integral number of disc blocks. For example, if <CODE>Cmd_Status</CODE> 
reports that the blocksize is 2048 and the file size is 3277 bytes, the 
program <I>must </I>read 4096 bytes. 
</UL>
<H3>Message: "O/S error -34 allocating space"</H3>
This error indicates that there is not enough contiguous space on the hard 
drive to lay down the CD-ROM image. Remember you need the amount of space 
you have defined in the <I>cdrom.tcl</I> file. You can also edit the 
<I>cdrom.tcl</I> file so the layout tool places the <I>cdrom.image</I> 
file on a hard disk that has enough space.<P>
<B>Note: </B>Consider defragmenting your hard disk if you have this 
problem.<P>
<H3>Problem: Layout is very slow</H3>
If you're using a Macintosh operating system earlier than 7.5, set file 
caching to 32 KB to speed up the layout tool. Note that this should not be 
necessary with the layout tool included with 3DO Portfolio 2.5.<P>
