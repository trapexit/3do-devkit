A 3DO title uses the CD-ROM as its data storage medium. CD-ROM technology, 
and its use in multimedia applications is still in its infancy. As The 3DO 
Company and its developers have worked with the CD-ROM device over the 
past year they learned a lot about maximizing drive performance and about 
the capabilities and limits of the medium.<P>
This appendix presents a collection of this information. It is intended to

The 3DO Company and its developers are forging new frontiers in CD-ROM 
technology, pushing the technology to its limits. With careful and 
well-planned execution, programmers can increase CD-ROM drive performance 
and reliability by employing several techniques for reducing head seeking, 
and making sure that they gracefully recover from data errors or 
slower-than-expected data delivery.<P>
