<H1><LINK NAME="XREF15476">Overview of Encryption 
Requirements</LINK></H1><HR>
When you submit a title for encryption, 3DO CD Operations checks that all 
requirements are met before starting the encryption process. This document 
summarizes the requirements, providing references to more detailed 
information as appropriate. <P>
<B>Warning: </B>3DO CD Operations will not encrypt titles that don't meet 
the requirements outlined here.<P>
<H2>Minimum memory testing</H2>
3DO Quality Assurance tests each title in both in the minimum memory 
environment, and in the nonrestricted full-memory environment. Each title 
is briefly tested before encryption, then for seven days after encryption. 
<P>
You can run the minmem utility in one of two ways: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Type <CODE>minmem</CODE> at the Debugger prompt after running the boot 
script but before launching your application.
<p>
<LI>Include <CODE>minmem</CODE> in the <I>AppStartup</I> script.
</UL>
See <A HREF="./02CDM004.html#XREF37473">Testing Your Title in the Minimum 
Memory Configuration</A> for more information.<P>
<H2>Low memory access</H2>
Your title must be low memory clean. See <A 
HREF="./02CDM003.html#XREF27784">Checking for Low Memory Pointers</A> for 
more information.<P>
<H2>Three-Second 3DO licensed product symbol</H2>
Each application is required to display the 3DO licensed product symbol, 
in at least quarter-screen height, for a minimum of three seconds when the 
title boots up. <P>
Use the files containing the 3DO licensed product symbol which are 
included on the installation CD-ROM at top level in the "Approved 3DO Logo 
Art" folder.<P>
The three-second 3DO licensed product symbol is not required if the title 
uses a banner screen (see <A HREF="./03CDM002.html#XREF24558">Preparing 
and Using a Banner Screen</A>). <P>
<H2>CD packaging and artwork</H2>
CD artwork and CD packaging artwork are inspected for adherence to 3DO 
guidelines. <I>Artwork within the application is not censored in any 
way</I>; only the CD surface and CD packaging artwork must conform to 
certain guidelines. <P>
The approval process is described in the Essentials Kit. <P>
Files you have to deliver<P>
3DO Developer Services needs to see the <I>/takeme</I> directory of your 
title to verify that you created your <I>cdrom.image</I> file with the 
appropriate 3DO system files.<P>
<p>
When you submit your title for encryption, include 
<UL>
<LI>the <I>cdrom.image</I> file
<p>
<LI>the <I>/takeme</I> directory (without executable and data files). 
</UL>
Deliver these files in HFS format on CD-ROM. Send at least two copies. See 
the Disc Processing Form for detail; a copy of that form is required for 
encryption. <P>
<H3>For More Information</H3>
The information above is only an overview of encryption requirements. For 
more detailed information, contact your account manager or 3DO CD 
Operations. <P>
