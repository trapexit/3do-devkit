<A NAME="XREF27348"><H2>Using Relative Pathnames</A></H2>
Applications should always use pathnames relative to the location from 
which the application boots. <P>
For example, during development an application boots from <I>/remote</I>. 
If artwork is located in <I>$boot/art....</I> , the program should refer 
to those files as <I>art/...</I>. During development, the pathname is then 
resolved to <I>/remote/art</I> since the program booted from 
<I>/remote</I>. <P>
A title should use <I>$boot</I> and other aliases explicitly only in cases 
where an absolute path is needed because the program would not know how to 
resolve a relative pathname. Generally, all programs should be able to 
resolve a relative pathname, with the current location being the point 
from which the program was entered.<P>
<B>Warning: </B>Never use /remote in a pathname; it won't be available on 
an end-user machine. <P>
<A NAME="XREF30313"><H2>Hints on Error Checking and Other Advice</A></H2>
Here are some common problems and advice on how to avoid them: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Check all function return values. Make sure a function never exits the 
program if an error results and that returned pointer values are not 
<CODE>NULL</CODE>.
<p>
<LI>Use printf() to facilitate debugging<B>. </B>The <CODE>printf()</CODE> 
statements in your program statements are displayed in the Debugger 
Terminal window when you run the application in Debugger mode. The<CODE> 
printf()</CODE> statements are dropped when you run in stand-alone mode. 
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B>Once you have generated a clean <I>cdrom.image</I> file, 
eliminate the <CODE>printf()</CODE> statements for a slightly more 
efficient title.<BR>
<p>
<LI>Don't use OpenMacLink(). The function is obsolete.
<p>
<LI>Read an integral number of blocks. When reading files from the CD-ROM, 
you must read an integral number of disc blocks. For example, if 
CMD_Status reports that the blocksize is 2048, and the file size is 3277 
bytes, you <I>must</I> read 4096 bytes. 
<p>
<LI>Don't forget to recompile and retest. If you changed your application 
don't forget to recompile it and test it once more.
