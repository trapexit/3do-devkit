Getting your title authorized and into the stores involves the following steps:<P>
<H2>1. Licensee Designs the Packaging</H2>
All licensees must design packaging using the guidelines in the Essentials Kit. If packaging does not adhere to the guidelines, the title cannot be accepted for encryption.<P>
<H2>2. Licensee Submits Preliminary Materials</H2>
Two to four weeks before software submission to The 3DO Company, the licensee prepares the following forms, discussed in this section:<P>

<LI>Completed TAF (title authorization form)
<p>
<LI>Completed ratings questionnaire
<p>
<LI>Completed packaging materials including manual, package, and CD art, as specified in the Packaging Guidelines included in the Essentials Kit.

Licensee must specify royalty payment method on the TAF. The two methods are discussed in detail in "<A HREF="./06CDM002.html#XREF11665">Right to Manufacture Authorization and Royalty Payment</A>" below. The licensee must fax a copy of the purchase order issued to the authorized pressing facility no matter which payment method is used.<P>
<B>Note: </B>Make sure a purchase order is faxed to The 3DO Company before encryption.<P>
<H3>Rating Questionnaire</H3>

Once packaging is approved by 3DO Creative Services, the TAF is forwarded to 3DO CD Operations.<P>
<H2>Non-Standard Titles</H2>
If your title is to be considered as royalty free (not for resale) or consists of more than one bundled disc, it requires some special handling. Contact both Priscilla McGee at Creative Services (415) 261 3152 and Brooke Fesperman at CD-Operations (415) 261 3138 for more information. <P>
<H2>3. Product Submission to 3DO</H2>
