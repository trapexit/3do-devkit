The Math folio offers a large number of functions that perform many common mathematical operations. Many of these functions use the special math hardware built into the 3DO architecture to give better performance.<P>
This chapter organizes the many Math folio calls in logical groupings so you can find the appropriate call for the math operation you want to perform. Most of these calls are very straightforward. For detailed information on the operation of each call, see the <I><A HREF="../spr/00spr1.html#XREF19549">3DO System Programmer's Reference</A>.</I><P>
Like all other folios, each task or thread that uses calls from the Math folio must open the folio explicitly using <CODE>OpenMathFolio()</CODE>.<P>
