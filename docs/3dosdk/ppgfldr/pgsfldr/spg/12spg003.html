Although event broker messages come in enough flavors to allow a task to carry out a variety of I/O operations through the event broker, the event broker's main function is to monitor events in user-interface devices and report the events to listening tasks. From a listener task's point of view, the process of event monitoring has the following steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Connecting to the event broker
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Create a message port
<LI>Create a configuration message
<LI>Create a configuration block
<LI>Send the configuration message to the event broker
<LI>Receive the event broker's connection reply message
</UL><BR>
<LI>Monitoring events through the event broker
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Wait for event messages on the allocated message port
<LI>Read an event message data block
<LI>Process event data block information (if desired)
<LI>Reply to the event broker for event message receipt
</UL><BR>

<LI>Changing configuration (if desired) or disconnecting from the event broker
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Send a new configuration data structure to the event broker
</UL><BR>
</OL>
