A TagArg is a data structure that is used throughout Portfolio. The structure provides potentially long and variable lists of parameters to system function calls. TagArgs, also referred to simply as tags, provide a very flexible and expandable mechanism that allows Portfolio to evolve with minimal impact on application code.<P>
