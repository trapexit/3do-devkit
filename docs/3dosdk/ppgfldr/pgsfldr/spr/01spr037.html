<H3>Notes</H3>
Although threads may be deleted as soon as the parent task has finished using it by calling <CODE>DeleteThread()</CODE>, threads are automatically deleted when they return, call <CODE>exit(),</CODE> or when their parent task is deleted or dies. <P>
Threads share memory with their parent tasks. This means that: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Memory that was allocated by a thread also belongs to the parent task. 
<LI>Memory that was allocated by a thread is not automatically deallocated when the thread is deleted but instead remains the property of the parent task. 
</UL>
If you create a thread using <CODE>CreateThread()</CODE>, you must delete it using <CODE>DeleteThread()</CODE>, which does special cleanup work. <P>
