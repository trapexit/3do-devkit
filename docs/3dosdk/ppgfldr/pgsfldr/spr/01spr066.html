<A NAME="XREF33874"></A>Frees a private block of memory.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>void FreeMemToMemList( MemList *ml, void *p, int32 size )</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
This procedure frees a private block of memory that was previously allocated by a call to <CODE>AllocMemFromMemList()</CODE>. You can also use it to add memory to a private memory list created by <CODE>AllocMemList()</CODE>. <P>
<B>Note: </B> The memory you free to a memory list must be either memory that was previously allocated from the list or (when adding new memory to the list) memory of the type specified (by the p argument of <CODE>AllocMemList()</CODE>) when the memory list was created. <P>
The block of memory is expected to begin and end on nicely aligned bounds; the alignment size can be obtained by calling <CODE>GetMemAllocAlignment()</CODE>. If the block is not properly aligned, the base is rounded up and the size is rounded down until alignment is achieved. <P>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>ml
<DD>A pointer to the memory list to which to free the memory. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>p
<DD>A pointer to the memory to free. This value may be NULL, in which case this function just returns. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>size
<DD>The number of bytes to free. This must be the same size that was passed to AllocMemFromMemList() to allocate the block. See <A HREF="#XREF31542">FreeMem</A> for additional information.
</DL>
<H3>Implementation</H3>
Folio call implemented in kernel folio V20. <P>
