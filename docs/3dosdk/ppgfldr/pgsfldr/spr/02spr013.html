<A NAME="XREF30520"></A>Loads a binary image and spawns it as a task, with priority.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>Item LoadProgramPrio(char *cmdLine, int32 priority);</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
This function loads an executable file from disk and launches a new task to execute the code. <P>
You give this function a command line to interpret. The first component of the command line is taken as the name of the file to load. The entirety of the command line is passed to the new task as argc and argv in the <CODE>main()</CODE> function. The filename component of the command line specifies either a fully qualified pathname, or a pathname relative to the current directory. <P>
The priority argument specifies the task priority to use for the new task. If you simply want the new task to have the same priority as the current task, use the <CODE>LoadProgram()</CODE> function instead. Alternatively, passing a negative priority to this function will also give the new task the same priority as the current task. <P>
If a priority was given to the executable being launched using the modbin utility, then the priority you give to this function is ignored, and the priority that was specified to modbin will be used instead. <P>
