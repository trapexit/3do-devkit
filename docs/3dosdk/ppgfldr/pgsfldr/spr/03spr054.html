<A NAME="XREF15989"></A> Multiplies a matrix within an object structure by an external 4x4 matrix of 16.16 values.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>void MulObjectMat44_F16( void *objectlist[],ObjOffset2 *offsetstruct, mat44f16 mat, int32 count )</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
This function multiplies a matrix within object structures by an external 4x4 matrix of 16.16 fractions, and repeats over a number of objects. The results of the product are deposited in the destination matrix in each object structure pointed to by the objectlist array. <P>
The object structure argument defines offsets within objects to the elements to be manipulated. The definition for ObjOffset2 is as follows: <P>
<CODE>typedef struct ObjOffset2 {int32 oo2_DestMatOffset; int32 oo2_SrcMatOffset;} ObjOffset2; </CODE><P>
<UL>
<LI>oo2_DestMatOffset is the offset (in bytes) from the beginning of an object structure to where to write the result of the matrix multiply. 
<LI>oo2_SrcMatOffset is the offset (in bytes) from the beginning of an object structure to the location of the matrix to be multiplied. 
</UL>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>objectlist
<DD>An array of pointers to object structures to modify. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>offsetstruct
<DD>A pointer to the source object structure that defines offsets within object's to the elements to be multiplied. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>mat
<DD>A 4x4 matrix of 16.16 fractions to be multiplied. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>count
<DD>The number of vectors for the multiplication.
