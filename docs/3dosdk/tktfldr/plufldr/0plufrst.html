This document provides tutorial-style and reference information for the 
custom plug-ins and custom code modules that are available on the 3DO\xaa  
Toolkit CD-ROM for use with Adobe Photoshop and DeBabelizer.<P>
You can use the custom plug-ins and custom code modules to create 3DO 
images and cels. You can also create anti-aliased cels and work with 
special effects such as translucency. <P>
<H2>How to use this document</H2>
This document helps you perform certain file conversions. Don't read it 
cover to cover; instead, go to the appropriate section, for example, 
"Converting art to a 3DO image," and follow the step-by-step instructions. 
For more detailed information about the individual dialogs see <A 
HREF="plu4frst.html#XREF24965">Plug-In Dialogs</A>.<P>
This document is written primarily for graphic artists who prepare the 
still art and animations for a 3DO title. A rudimentary knowledge of Adobe 
Photoshop and DeBabelizer is helpful but not required.<P>

information about many of the dialogs used in the examples in the previous 
chapters. <P>
<A HREF="plu5frst.html#XREF39344">3DO Custom Code Module for 
DeBabelizer</A>," steps you through creating animations and streamed 
animations and creating a list of cel files from an animation. <P>
<H1>Installing the Custom Plug-Ins and CCMs</H1>
Custom plug-ins or custom code modules work correctly only if they are in 
the right folder on the Macintosh hard drive. To install them correctly, 
follow one of these procedures:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Use the Easy Install option for installing the Toolkit. 
<p>
<LI>If you want to use custom plug-ins, drag all files in the <I>Artist  
Tools: </I><I>Photoshop Plug-Ins</I> folder into the <I>Adobe 
Photoshop:Plug-ins</I> folder.
<p>
<LI>If you want to use the custom code modules, drag all files in the 
<I>ArtistTools:CCMs</I> into <I>DeBabelizer Folder:Custom Code</I>.
</OL>
If you perform installation using the Custom Install option, don't install 
the plug-ins or CCMs but drag them directly from the folder on the CD-ROM 
to the folder on your hard disk. <P>
