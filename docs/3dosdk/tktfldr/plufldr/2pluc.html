There are two tools for saving source art as a coded cel: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Use the CelWriter to save source art as a 6-bit, 4-bit, 2-bit, or 
1-bit coded cel (described below). 
<LI>Use the Coded-8 CelWriter to save source art as an 8-bit coded cel 
(described in "<A HREF="./2plud.html#XREF42159">Creating cels with the 3DO 
Coded-8 CelWriter</A>").
</UL>
<H2>How to create a coded cel</H2>
Creating a coded cel usually involves two steps, discussed in this 
section:<P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#XREF22730">Indexing the color in Photoshop</A>-only 
necessary if the source art has more colors than the cel will have.
<LI><A HREF="#XREF38379">Saving the cel</A>.
</UL>
<A NAME="XREF22730"><H3>Indexing the color in Photoshop</A></H3>
To index the color in Photoshop, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>From the Mode menu in Photoshop, choose Indexed Color. 
<p>
<LI>Select the bits per pixel you want to save:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>For 16 or 6 bits per pixel, choose 5 bits per pixel. 
<LI>For 4 bits per pixel, choose 4 bits per pixel.
<LI>For 2 bits per pixel, type 4 into the Other field of the dialog. 
<LI>For 1-bit coded cels, type 2 into the Other field. 
</UL>
<p>
<LI>Select a custom palette and a diffusion dither. When you click OK, a 
Color Table dialog appears. 
<p>
<LI>Click the Load button and use the file selection dialog to specify a 
3DO-supplied color table. Note the table you use: You'll have to adjust 
control settings accordingly later. 
<p>
<LI>From the Mode menu, choose RGB color. 
</OL>
<A NAME="XREF38379"><H3>Saving the cel</A></H3>
To save the cel, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>From the File menu, select Export &gt; 3DO CelWriter.
<p>
<LI>In the dialog that appears, select the Coded type, then the Bits Per 
Pixel you decided to use. 
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B>Don't choose 8 bits per pixel, the Coded-8 CelWriter 
discussed in the next section should be used for that purpose. <BR>
<p>

<LI>Click the Set Cel Flags button and make sure the cel corresponds to 
the color table if you created one:
<UL>
<LI>If you select 3-3-2 Color Table (REP8 clear), make sure the box 
"Replicate LSB's in RGB 8 bit Cel" box in the Control Settings dialog is 
unchecked. 
<p>
<LI>If you select 3-3-2 Color Table (REP8 set), make sure the box is 
checked.
</UL><BR>

<LI>Choose Save and you're finished.
</OL>
