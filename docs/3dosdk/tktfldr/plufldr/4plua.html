The following options are available for  determining how an image is 
created:<P>
<H3>VDL Type</H3>
A video display list (VDL) consists of a color table and some additional 
information. Use this box to choose between a standard color table or a 
custom (image-specific) color table. For more information, see the 
chapter, "Understanding the Display Generator," of the <I>3DO Portfolio 
Programmer's Guide</I>. <P>
<H3>Standard VDL</H3>
Selects a standard (system-supplied) 5-5-5 VDL or a standard 5-5-4-0 VDL. 
The 5-5-4-0 color table clears the lowest blue bit for cornerweighting 
information.<P>
<H3>Custom VDL</H3>
Selects a custom color table. This is useful if the image shows "banding" 
after reduction to 15-bit color for the frame buffer.<P>
<UL>
<LI>If you choose Dynamic, the Image Writer creates a different color 
table for each scanline. 
<LI>If you choose Fixed, the Image Writer uses the system color table for 
the image. 
</UL>
The Color Reduction pop-up menu provides various choices for color 
reduction. Use the default. <P>
