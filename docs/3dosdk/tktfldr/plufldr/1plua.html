</UL>
<H3>For more information</H3>
If your source has a lot of its colors at one end of the spectrum, 
consider creating an image with a custom VDL (see <A 
HREF="./1plub.html#XREF25885">Creating images with custom VDLs</A>). <P>
<A NAME="XREF28979"><H2>Resizing source art</A></H2>
To save images in the proper size, you have to consider the following 
issues: <P>
<UL>
<LI>On NTSC screens, the maximum display size for a 3DO image 320 x 240.
</UL>
<DL>
<DD>
<UL>
<LI>If the image is larger, only the upper-left area is displayed.
<p>
<LI>If the image is smaller, it is displayed in the upper-left corner and 
the areas not used are displayed in black.

<H3>How to resize source art</H3>
To resize source art, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>From the Image menu, choose Image Size.<P>

<IMG SRC="Figures/PLU1.figs/ImageSize.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be 
displayed">
<P>
<B>Figure 1: </B><I>Dialog for resizing an image in Photoshop.</I><P>

<LI>In the dialog, change the units to pixels and specify either height or 
width, using the appropriate numbers for NTSC (320 x 240) or PAL (384 x 
288). Make sure that Resolution is 72 pixels/inch and that Constrain 
Proportions is checked and Constrain File Size is not checked, and choose 
OK. 
<p>
<p>Photoshop scales the source art to the specified size. If you prefer 
to crop the source art, use the Canvas Size command.

<A NAME="XREF22813"><H2>Exporting source art with the 3DO Image 
Writer</A></H2>
To export source art with the 3DO Image Writer, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>From the File menu, choose Export &gt; 3DO ImageWriter.
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B>To generate a PAL image (384 x 288), choose Export &gt; 
PAL Image Writer.<BR>
<p>

<LI>Specify the name of the image. Using the extension .img is recommended.
<p>
<p>The dialog shown in the figure below lets you choose the export 
options for the image.

<LI>In the VDL Type box, choose Standard.
<p>
<LI>Next, decide the type of standard VDL you want to use:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Standard 5-5-5 uses five bits each for red, green, and blue. 
<p>
<LI>Standard 5-5-4-0 uses five bits each for red and green but leaves the 
lowest bit of blue for cornerweighting. 
</UL><BR>
<p><B>Note: </B>If the original image has 24 bits per pixel, the tool 
discards the bottom three bits of the red, green, and blue part to prepare 
the image for the frame buffer and the image will not look exactly as it 
did on the Macintosh screen. A custom VDL, discussed below, may be helpful 
in this situation.<BR>
<p>

<LI>Choose OK to save the image. 
<p>
<p>You can check the Suppress Warnings box if you anticipate warnings 
during the conversion process and don't want to see them.
