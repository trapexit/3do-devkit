To convert 16-bit source art to a simple 16-bit uncoded cel, follow these 
steps: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Load the source art into Photoshop. 
<p>
<LI>From the File menu, choose Export &gt; 3DO CelWriter, then choose Save 
in the dialog. An extension .cel or .CEL is recommended. 
<p>
<p>The CelWriter dialog appears.

<p>
<LI>In the dialog, select Uncoded in the Type box.
<p>
<LI>Select the number of bits per pixel. 
<p>
<p>If you started with 24-bit source art and choose 16 bits per pixel, 
the tool discards the bottom three bits in the red, green, and blue 
channels while it saves the cel. This may result in a color distortion of 
the cel. 
<p>
<LI>Choose Save to export the cel.
</OL>
<A NAME="XREF36604"><H2>How to convert 24-bit source art to an 8-bit 
uncoded cel</A></H2>
If the source art image used is 24 or 16 bits per pixel and you want to 
save an 8-bit uncoded cel, you need to index the colors into a different 
color table before you start the export process, since you can't save all 
the bits in the cel. <P>
<OL>
<LI>From the Mode menu in Photoshop, choose Indexed Color.
<p>
<LI>In the dialog that appears, choose a resolution of 8 bits per pixel, 
and a custom palette.
In many situations, it also helps to choose a diffusion dither. <P>

<p>
<LI>When you click OK, a Color Table dialog appears. 
<p>
<LI>Choose Load and use the file selection dialog to specify one of the 
3DO-supplied color tables, 3-3-2 Color Table (REP8 clear) or 3-3-2 Color 
Table (REP8 set).<P>

<p>
<LI>After the color table has been loaded, choose OK to apply it to the 
source art.
<p>
<LI>From the Mode menu, choose RGB color, since the CelWriter cannot save 
files in indexed color. 
<p>
<LI>From the File menu, choose Export &gt; 3DO CelWriter, then choose Save 
in the file selection dialog. An extension .cel or .CEL is recommended.
<p>
<LI>In the dialog, select Uncoded in the Type box.
<p>
<LI>Select the number of bits per pixel. 
<p>
<LI>If you started with 24-bit source art and choose 16 bits per pixel, 
the tool discards the bottom three bits in the red, green, and blue 
channels while it saves the cel. This may result in a color distortion of 
the cel. 
<p>
<LI>In the CelWriter dialog, click Set Cel Flags and make sure the color 
table matches the Control Settings:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>If you select 3-3-2 Color Table (REP8 clear), make sure the box 
"Replicate LSB's in RGB 8 bit Cel" box in the Control Settings dialog is 
unchecked. 
<p>
<LI>If you select 3-3-2 Color Table (REP8 set), make sure the box is 
checked.
</UL><BR>

<LI>Choose Save to export the cel.
</OL><P>
<B>Note: </B> If you need more control over the color table, use the 3DO 
Animator tool instead. <P>
