A custom VDL (video display list) is useful if the 3DO Image Writer has to 
reduce the number of colors during conversion. It is especially 
recommended if the image shows banding after the colors have been reduced 
to 15-bit. <P>
This section discusses images with custom VDLs:<P>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#XREF13506">Creating an image with a custom VDL</A>, 
contains step-by-step instructions.

background about custom VDLs.

<A NAME="XREF13506"><H2>Creating an image with a custom VDL</A></H2>
If you choose a custom VDL, the Image Writer creates a color table based 
on the image you are working with. This is helpful, for example, if you 
start out with 24-bit source art: The Image Writer can perform color 
reduction based on the characteristics of the picture you are dealing 
with. There are two options:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The dynamic VDL is computed on a scanline-by-scanline basis. 
<LI>The fixed VDL is computed once and used for the entire image.

<H3>How to create an image with a custom VDL</H3>
To convert your source art to an image using a custom VDL, follow these 
steps: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Resize the image if necessary (see <A 
HREF="./1plua.html#XREF28979">Resizing source art</A>).
<p>
<LI>From the File menu, choose Export &gt; 3DO Image Writer.
<p>
<LI>Specify the name of the image. An extension .img is recommended.
<p>
<LI>In the dialog that appears, choose Custom in the "VDL type" box. 
<p>
<LI>Choose between dynamic and fixed VDL.
<p> 
<UL>
<LI>If you choose Dynamic, the Image Writer creates a custom VDL on a 
scanline-by-scanline basis. 
<p> 
<LI>If you choose Fixed, the Image Writer uses the system VDL for the 
image. 
</UL><BR>
<p>
<LI>Leave the default color reduction method: BoxPopLength sort.
<p>
<LI>If you expect to draw cels on top of the image, choose the CLUT bypass 
option.
<p>
<p>This option allows the parts of the image that are covered by the cel 
to use the standard VDL instead of the custom VDL. In addition to setting 
the CLUT bypass option for the image, you also need to set the high bit of 
the frame buffer pixel for the cel. This has to be done by the program 
that displays the cel. 
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B> You can have transparent and opaque cel pixels on top of 
an image that uses a custom VDL. Translucent cels will not work correctly 
even if you have turned on the CLUT bypass option, because the cel engine 
assumes a linear ascending CLUT. <BR>
<p>
<LI>Choose OK and you're done. 
</OL>

discusses additional options you have when creating images with 
a custom VDL.<P>
<A NAME="XREF11822"><H2>Standard and custom VDLs</A></H2>
A VDL is a list of display control commands that tell the video display 
list processor (VDLP) how to control the display generator. A VDL contains 
information about three color lookup tables (CLUTs) that the 3DO hardware 
uses to index the color from the 15-bit frame buffer color to the 24-bit 
color your TV uses. <P>
<UL>
<LI>The standard (system-supplied) color table divides red, green, and 
blue into even parts, using the same 32 shades for each image. 
<p>
<LI>A custom VDL using a custom color table tries to stay as close to the 
original colors as possible, which is useful if they all belong to the 
same range (for example, 32 shades of blue). 
</UL>
<H3>About custom VDLs</H3>
The standard VDL uses the standard (system-supplied) color table, which 
means that the 8-bit values contained in the CLUT are linear ascending. 
They ascend in even intervals from a low value in register 0 to a high 
value in register 31. For example, they may ascend in steps of 8-from 0 in 
register 0 to 255 in register 
31-0, 7, 15, 23, 31, 39, and so on. Banding may occur because the cel 
engine assumes a linear palette that covers the full range of the color 
spectrum when it scales color values to create lighting effects. For 
example, if the cel engine multiplies the red, green, and blue components 
of a 15-bit color value by 1.5, it assumes that the higher resulting color 
value will result in a brighter (or darker) color, which is true if the 
palette is linear and is either ascending or descending.<P>

To understand how custom color tables work,see <A

from the frame buffer to the TV screen. <P>
