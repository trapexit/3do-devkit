When you choose Export &gt; 3DO CelWriter from the File menu, the 3DO 
CelWriter dialog that lets you specify the characteristics of the cel. <P>

<H3>Type</H3>
Cels can be coded or uncoded. <P>
<UL>
<LI>An uncoded cel contains RGB pixel data. A 16-bit uncoded cel also 
supports a P-Mode bit per pixel.
<p>
<LI>A coded cel is associated with a color table. Each cel pixel contains, 
among other things, an index into this table. 
</UL><BR>
<H3>Bits Per Pixel</H3>
Uncoded cels can be 16 or 8 bits per pixel. Coded cels can be 16, 8, 6, 4, 
2 bits or 1 bit per pixel. <P>
<H3>P-Mode Settings</H3>
P-Mode settings allow you to separate a cel into two or more pixel groups 
for special effects. For example, you could create an opaque car with a 
translucent windshield. <P>
The P-Mode Settings box in the CelWriter dialog let you edit and delete an 
existing P-Mode preset and create new P-Mode presets. <P>
To edit or delete an existing P-Mode preset, select it as P-Mode 0 and 
click Edit or Delete. To create a new P-Mode, choose New. Suppose you are 
working with the example given earlier, the opaque car with a translucent 
windshield. To make a cel with these characteristics, start with a car 
image and create an extra channel that is white (On) where the windows are 
and black (Off) for the car body. The extra channel becomes Channel 4 so 
P-Mode 0 applies for every black pixel in Channel 4 and P-Mode 1 applies 
for every non-black pixel in Channel 4. If you select Translucent for 
P-Mode 1, the car's windshield will average with the background to produce 
a translucent effect.<P>
When the AV bits are used as the second source divider instead of an adder 
value, the USEAV bit in the cel control block is set automatically. 
Because the USEAV bit applies to <I>both</I> P-Mode 0 and 1, your cel may 
not display as you expect. Recheck your P-Mode settings and make sure you 
are not using the adder value.<P>
<H3>Channel Assignments</H3>

<I>Channel Assignment Options.</>
Whenever you export an RGB image from Photoshop, at least three channels 
are sent to the 3DO CelWriter plug-in: red, green, and blue. You can add 
extra channels to the image from Photoshop. The 3DO Export plug-in can 
then use these extra channels to set the additional information. <P>
If several extra channels are available for the currently selected cel 
type and bits per pixel, you can change the default assignments by 
selecting a different channel.<P>
Not all cel configurations support all possible channel assignment 
features. As you change the cel type and bits per pixel, the Channel 
Assignments options change. For example, if a cel cannot support P-Mode, 
the P-Mode channel is set to Not Allowed. <P>
