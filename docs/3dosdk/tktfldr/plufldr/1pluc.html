<H2>About the 3DO Artist Card</H2>
You can buy the 3DO Artist Card Bundle as a separate product from The 3DO 
Company. The Artist Card allows you to view art on the NTSC screen by 
means of the 3DO Animator tool, the 3DO Image Writer plug-in, or the 3DO 
ImagePreview plug-in.<P>
You cannot use the 3DO Artist Card to display cels on top of images-for 
example, to test transparency or translucency effects-but you can preview 
how the art looks with the VDL you have chosen. <P>
<B>Note: </B>3DO PostPro, a new tool in Toolkit 1.5, lets you preview 
images or cels using the 3DO Artist Card or the 3DO Station. <P>
