One operation you'll frequently find useful is conversion of a QuickTime 
movie to a series of 3DO cels. You can then display the cels individually 
on the 3DO Station, edit them on the Macintosh as needed, and end up with 
the animation sequence of your choice.<P>

<LI>If you intend to save all frames in the movie, use a setup like the 
one above: 
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Choose Step to Next Interesting Frame.
<LI>Click on Set to End.
</UL><BR>
<LI>If you want to save only a number of frames, starting at the 
beginning, type a number into the "Don't go past unit" box. You can find 
out how many units one step consists of by clicking on the Next 
Interesting Frame button once or twice. 
<p>
<LI>After you click OK, the CCB dialog and the CelWriter dialog appear. 
Follow the instructions in Steps 9-11 above to respond to them. 
<p>
<p>DeBabelizer saves the individual files into the directory you specify. 
You can then load the cels into Adobe Photoshop or DeBabelizer, using the 
3DO CelReader Import plug-in to edit them as needed, and display them on 
the 3DO Station after you've made all desired changes.
