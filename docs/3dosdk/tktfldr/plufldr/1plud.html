To load a 3DO image file, choose Acquire &gt; 3DO ImageReader from the File menu. The plug-in loads the image into Photoshop, where you can make changes to the image. When you later export the same image, using Export &gt; 3DO Image Writer, you will find that the settings for the Image Writer dialogs are the same as when you last saved that image. <P>
