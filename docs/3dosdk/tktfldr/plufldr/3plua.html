When you save source art as a 3DO cel, you can use additional channels in Photoshop for certain special effects that the 3DO hardware can create. This chapter gives step-by-step examples for creating irregularly shaped cels and for using special effects. Here's an overview of what you can do: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Create an irregularly shaped cel by first creating a mask that indicates the region you want transparent. Then assign the channel of that mask to the Transparency channel of the cel. 
<p>
<LI>Make parts of your cel bright or translucent by specifying those parts in a mask. If the cel type permits, you can use one mask for transparency, the other mask to indicate the special effects region.
<p>
<LI>Enhance the red, green, or blue channel to highlight that color only, copy that channel into a separate channel and save it as a mask with a special pixel mode. 
<p>
<LI>Make the whole cel translucent or dark for ghost or shadow effects.
</UL>
<B>Note: </B>For more information, see "Introduction to 3DO Graphics" in this volume.<P>
<H2>Which channels can I use?</H2>
The cel type and the number of bits per pixel determine whether additional channels are available for a given cel. The CelWriter dialog makes certain options unavailable for certain cel types. If a channel does not make sense for a certain kind of cel, it is dimmed in the dialog. <P>
