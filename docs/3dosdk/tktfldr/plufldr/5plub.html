<H1><LINK NAME="XREF38295">Creating a 3DO animation</LINK></H1><HR>
The 3DO CCM for DeBabelizer offers conversion to two different animation 
formats: <P>
<UL>
<LI>A simple animation (ANIM) is one file consisting of 3DO cels and 
information about the frame rate. 
<p>
<LI>A streamed animation (SANM) is an animation which has been prepared 
for weaving by the 3DO Data Streamer's Weaver tool. 
</UL>
<B>Note: </B>Before you convert a file or set of files, make sure the 
number of colors does not exceed the colors permissible for the type of 
cel you create. You can perform color reduction in your favorite graphics 
tool or, if you're familiar with DeBabelizer, include it in a script that 
also does the conversion.<P>
<H2>How to create an ANIM file with the CCM</H2>
To create an ANIM file with the CCMm follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Open DeBabelizer.<P> 
<p>
<LI>From the File menu, choose Batch, then Save Simple from the submenu.<P>
<p>
<LI>Specify the file or files in the left panel of the dialog: <P>
<p>
<p>If you're converting a series of frames, click on New, then create the 
batch list using the dialog that appears.
<p>
<p>If you're converting an animation or QuickTime movie, create a batch 
list consisting of a single file. 
<p>
<B>Note: </B>You can follow the corresponding steps to create a SANM. <P>

<B>Figure 1: </B><I>Dialog for saving a simple animation.</I><P>

<LI>In the right panel, click on Auto Naming Options and type a name for 
your animation (see the figure above). 
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B>When creating an animation from a list of files, make 
sure to supply a single new name. <BR>

<p>
<LI>Click on the Set button in the Save: region of the Batch Save Simple 
dialog to specify the directory for the 3DO animation. 
<p>
<LI>Bring up the Type pop-up, choose 3DO, and choose the desired type from 
the submenu. 
<p>
<LI>Click DO IT to start the conversion process.
<p>
<p>If you've selected Anim, the following dialog appears next:

<p>
<p>If you select Single CCB, the CCM saves one CCB for all frames in the 
animation. This is usually preferable for uncoded cels. 
<p>
<p>If you select Add Header, you can then determine the frame rate. 
<p>
<LI>Check "Skip this box" unless you want to make changes for future 
frames. 
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B>If the dialog has been used before and the "Skip this box 
next time" box was checked, hold down the Option key while clicking DO IT 
to override.<P>
<p>
Next, you are prompted for the cel type. You will see the CelWriter 
dialog.

<p>
<p>You can currently save 16-bit and 8-bit uncoded cels and 6-bit, 4-bit, 
2-bit, and 1-bit coded cels with the CelWriter CCM. Note that 8-bit 
uncoded cels are rarely desirable, since you have no control over the 
palette.
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B>To save an 8-bit coded cel, use the Coded-8 CCM 
discussed  in <A HREF="./2pluc.html#XREF10727">Creating coded cels with 
the 3DO CelWriter</A>. <BR>
<p>
<LI>Select the cel type you need, then check the Suppress Dialogs box 
unless you expect to make a different selection for the next frame. 
<p>
<UL>
<LI>DeBabelizer saves the first file, reporting progress in a dialog. 
<p>

<LI>When DeBabelizer gets to the second file, you are prompted for a new 
name.
</UL> 
<p>
<LI>Click Replace All to create one animation file containing all the 
frames in the list or the QuickTime movie.
</OL>
