To understand the options in the top part of the dialog, consult <A HREF="../../ppgfldr/ggsfldr/gpgfldr/2gpg.html#XREF34189">Understanding the Display Generator</A>.<P>
Note that several of the options are useful only if SlipStream supplies a 
video source to be superimposed on the existing image. This is not 
possible in this release of the hardware. <P>
<H2>The CLUT bypass option</H2>
<UL>
<LI>While converting the source art, you need to set the CLUT bypass 
option for the image to force a standard VDL for any pixel for which the 
high bit is set.
<p>
<LI>The program that displays the cel needs to set the high bit in the cel 
using the <CODE>SetCEControl()</CODE> function.
</UL>
The frame buffer will now use the standard (system-supplied) VDL instead 
of the custom VDL for each pixel that has the high bit set-that is, for 
each pixel that is part of the specially prepared cel. <P>
<B>Note: </B>You can have transparent and opaque cel pixels on top of an 
image that uses a custom VDL. Translucent cels will not work correctly 
even if you have turned on the CLUT bypass option because the cel engine 
assumes a linear ascending CLUT. <P>
