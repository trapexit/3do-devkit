This document gives an introduction to music and sound effects for 
3DO\xaa  titles, provides tutorial-style and reference information for all 
3DO Sound Designer tools, and contains additional troubleshooting and 
reference information.<P>
<H1>Audience</H1>
This book is for sound designers who want to prepare music for the 3DO 
Station. While some background in composing digital audio is useful, it is 
not required. To understand how to work with the MIDI synthesizing 
capability of the ARIA tool, you need at least a rudimentary background in 
MIDI.<P>

<LI><A HREF="sdt1frst.html#XREF25387">Music and Sound Effects for 3DO

you started with 3DO audio.
<LI><A HREF="sdt2frst.html#XREF21703">Installing and Launching ARIA</A>
