effects into your title</LINK></H1><HR>
Once you're satisfied with the sound effects or music you have produced, a 
programmer has to incorporate it into the title in the appropriate way. 
This section explains how sound can be played on the 3DO system. It helps 
nonprogrammers understand the principles behind audio on the 3DO system 
and gives references to the appropriate sections of the <I>3DO Portfolio 
Programmer's Guide</I> for more in-depth coverage. <P>
<H2>Playing MIDI scores </H2>
The 3DO system is set up to allow MIDI score playing, which is more 
interactive than spooling. You can use the ARIA tool to develop synthetic 
patches (instruments) or to attach sample files to MIDI notes.<P>
You can attach MIDI notes to synthetic sounds or AIFF samples, depending 
on RAM availability and system resources. Synthetic instruments take the 
least amount of RAM, but may result in involve a small processing 
overhead. On the Toolkit 1.4 CD-ROM (and later), you can find a library of 
AIFF samples to use in your titles. An overview is provided in 
<A HREF="sdtBfrst.html#XREF25541">AIFF Samples</A> .<P>
You can use hierarchical score structures for dramatic construction; for 
more information, see the documentation on the Music Library.<P>
<H2>Streaming audio data with the 3DO DataStreamer</H2>
You can fade or mix several channels of digital audio samples for dramatic 
purposes, but remember bandwidth limitations. The <I>3DO Data Streamer 
Programmer's Guide</I> discusses data streaming and provides manpages for 
all relevant functions in the DataStreamer library. <P>
