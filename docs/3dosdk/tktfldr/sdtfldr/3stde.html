The basic process of creating blocks and editing their characteristics is 
actually the same no matter how complex the patch you create.<P>
This section shows you how to create a patch that contains an aiff sample 
file instead of a simple wave form. <P>
<H2>Creating a sampler patch</H2>
To create a patch that contains a sample file, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>If you want, close any old patch documents and open a new one. 
<p>
<LI>Create a sampler block, which is the block immediately to the right of 
the envelope.
<p>
<LI>Place two knobs to the left of the sampler and an Output block to the 
right of it. 
<p>
<LI>Connect an aiff sample to the sampler block click on the AIFF button 
in the sampler block and select an AIFF sample in the file selection 
dialog that appears. 
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B>Samples must always be embedded. In earlier versions the 
sample file was allowed not to be embedded, which meant that you had the 
same folder structure when you created the patch as when you played it.<BR>
<p>

<LI>Connect knobs, sampler, and Output block as explained in <A 
HREF="./3stdb.html#XREF35120">Creating your first patch</A>. 
</OL>

<A NAME="XREF27189"><H2>Compiling and playing the sampler patch</A></H2>
To hear the whole patch on the 3DO Station:<P>
<OL>
<LI>From the File menu, choose Save to save the patch as a Macintosh file. 
<p>
<LI>From the Patch menu, select Compile Patch. 
<p>
<LI>From the Patch menu, use Start Patch (and Stop Patch) to play the 
patch- or press the Space bar to start the patch, then press it twice more 
to release and stop it.
</OL>
<H2>Tips and tricks</H2>
This section gives a few tips and trips for working with sampler patches. 
<P>
<H3>Experimenting with other blocks </H3>
Creating patches becomes more interesting if you use filter blocks to 
filter out part of the sample or envelopes to modify its frequency or 
amplitude. Using envelopes is explained in the next section. <P>
<H3>Making a sample part of a PIMap</H3>
You can create a patch with no sample in the sample block and make it part 
of a PIMap you use to play a MIDI file. See 
<A HREF="#XREF15081">MIDI files and PIMap files</A>.<P>
<H3>Creating a multisample instrument</H3>
If you plan to create a multisample instrument from a patch, the patch 
must not have a sample assigned to it when you compile it. You must attach 
the samples to the instruments in the PIMap, with their note ranges and 
other parameters specified there. <P>
The patch names on such samples must be correct in your PIMap, and must be 
inside the <I>/remote</I> folder. <P>
