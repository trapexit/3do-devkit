If you decide not to use the installer for installing ARIA, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Find the ARIA folder on the CD-ROM. 
<p>
<p>The folder contains the ARIA application and an ARIA Examples folder which contains examples you can work with from ARIA. There are some patch documents and some MIDI examples.
<p>

<LI>Copy the ARIA application to your hard disk. 
<p>
<p>If you want, you can also copy the examples.
<p>

<LI>Go through the steps in "<A HREF="./2sdtb.html#XREF38788">Files and folder setup</A>."
<p>
<LI>If you expect to use samples to play MIDI, copy the AIFF samples folder from the Toolkit 1.4 CD-ROM into your <I>/remote</I> folder. 
</OL>
<DL>
<DD><B>Note: </B>The AIFF samples are not System 7 snd files and therefore cannot be previewed with Sound Manager 3.0.<BR>
