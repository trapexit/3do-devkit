PatchDemo is a program that runs on the 3DO development system. It lets 
you experiment with DSP instruments in a fast and interactive way. Use 
this program to listen to and prototype complicated DSP instrument 
configurations for later use in a 3DO title.<P>
Using PatchDemo and writing PatchDemo scripts is described in 
<A HREF="sdt3first.html#XREF36060">Creating Patches with ARIA</A>.<P>
<H2>How to use PatchDemo scripts with ARIA</H2>
ARIA lets you work with PatchDemo in two ways: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Write a PatchDemo script, then import it into ARIA and modify the 
blocks to suit your needs.
<p>
<LI>Create a patch in ARIA, then export it as a PatchDemo script. Load the 
script into PatchDemo and work with the patch there. 
</UL>
You can work with a PatchDemo script as follows: <P>

--------------------------------------------------------
To...                |Do this...                        
--------------------------------------------------------
Import a PatchDemo   |From the File menu, choose Import 
script               |PatchDemo Script. ARIA creates and
                     |connects the blocks corresponding 
                     |to the script.                    
--------------------------------------------------------
Export a PatchDemo   |From the File menu, choose Export 
script               |PatchDemo Script. ARIA creates a  
                     |script that corresponds to the    
                     |block structure of the current    
                     |patch.                            
--------------------------------------------------------

<P>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
ARIA supports envelope blocks and PatchDemo does not. You therefore can't 
export patches containing envelope blocks. <P>
PatchDemo supports delay lines and ARIA does not. You therefore can't 
import PatchDemo scripts referring to delay lines. <P>
