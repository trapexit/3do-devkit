PatchDemo is a program that runs on the 3DO development system. It lets you experiment with DSP instruments in a fast and interactive way. Use this program to listen to and prototype complicated DSP instrument configurations for later use in a program.<P>
The PatchDemo program has the following features:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Runs native on 3DO development systems.
<LI>Reads a text file describing the patch; no C programming is required.
<LI>Has a graphical user interface that provides interactive control of patch parameters.
<LI>Can play any standard DSP instrument.
</UL>

The 3DO Digital Signal Processor (DSP) is a powerful software synthesis engine. In order to make use of that power, the audio folio provides an extremely flexible modular synthesis model and a variety of modules called DSP instruments. However, writing a program to connect several DSP instruments is not a trivial task and doesn't provide a simple method to experiment with different configurations, settings, and so on. Because of this, there is a temptation to only do simple things, such as play back samples.<P>
PatchDemo solves this problem by providing an environment in which the existing DSP instruments can be connected in complicated arrangements without the programming overhead. You can describe a <I>patch</I> (a list of DSP instruments and connections between them) in a text file using a simple command set; PatchDemo deals with the operating system. PatchDemo then plays the patch and lets you adjust the instruments knob settings with the control pad.<P>
Because PatchDemo is so easy to use, it provides a fast way to experiment with the various DSP instruments so you can get on with the job of designing sounds. Once you have a patch file that you like, it can be used as a template for writing C code.<P>
