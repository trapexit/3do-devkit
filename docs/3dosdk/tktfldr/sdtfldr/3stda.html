<H2>Patch document window</H2>
The Patch document window is the large window below the tool palette. In it, you can create patches, as explained in the rest of this chapter. <P>
<H3>Saving and compiling patch documents</H3>
When you save a patch document, ARIA creates a patch file you can later load back into ARIA for further editing. When you compile a patch, on the other hand, ARIA creates a file you can use on the 3DO Station. <P>
<H2>Log window</H2>
ARIA has a Log window which appears when certain errors occur. If you want to see the Log window when it's not visible, use the Log Window command on the Windows menu. <A NAME="XREF35596"></A><P>
