<H2>AIFF files in Examples folder</H2>
The AIFF sample file in the Example folder were generated with a DigiDesign AudioMedia II board. Just save the files in AIFF mono or stereo file format. Mono is typically used for sound effects. Stereo is typically used for sound tracks. Any software that can save a sound file in AIFF format is acceptable. <P>
<H2>AIFF and compression</H2>
AIFF is not a compressed file format. The AIFF-C file format supports compression but does not require it. AIFF-C files may have a compression type of NONE, which makes them functionally equivalent to AIFF files. The audio folio supports a 2:1 compression scheme that writes AIFF-C files. <P>
You can create a compressed AIFF-C file using the SquashSound MPW tool or the SoundHack tool. SquashSnd 1.1 can compress both mono and stereo AIFF and AIFF-C files. <P>
