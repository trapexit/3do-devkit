An envelope sets the shape of an audio parameter plotted over time. An 
envelope typically controls one of an instrument's attributes such as its 
amplitude, timbre, or frequency. <P>
The ARIA tool lets you set sustain loops, release loops, release points, 
and other attributes for the envelope simply by editing its graphic 
representation. <P>
The section below shows you how to add an envelope to a simple patch. A 
tips and tricks section gives some advice from our developers. <P>
<H2>Preparing a patch with an envelope</H2>

<A NAME="XREF34375"><H3>Adding an envelope to a patch</A></H3>
To add an envelope to an existing patch, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Select the envelope block in the Tool bar and drag an envelope block 
in front of the item (waveform or sampler) you want to modify and after 
the attribute you want to modify (see Figure 1 below for a complete patch 
with an envelope). 
<p>
<LI>Cut the wire connecting the waveform or sample and its knob by 
Option-dragging, as explained under "<A 
HREF="./3stdb.html#XREF34597">Connecting and disconnecting blocks</A>." 
<p>
<LI>Connect the knob, the envelope, and the waveform or sampler by 
dragging the lines from the output of one to the input of the other.

Editing an envelope is done from the Envelope Editor window, shown in 
Figure 2 below. <P>

<UL>
<LI>Magnifying glass to zoom in/zoom out.

<LI>Tool to set/clear a release jump point, that is, a point where the 
sound will continue if you jump out of a loop.
<LI>Checkbox for the FLS (Fat Lady Sings) bit, which clears all memory 
allocated to the patch after the system exits it.

<A NAME="XREF32322"><H3>Editing an envelope</A></H3>
To edit an envelope, follow these steps: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Click on the envelope's Edit button. 
<p>
<LI>Move the start point in the top-left corner further down as desired. 
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B> The start point is initially invisible. Just grab the 
top-left corner and you will find you can move the point. <BR>
<p>

<LI>Add more points by holding the Option button and clicking or dragging 
the line. 
<p>
<LI>To set a sustain loop, drag out a marquee by holding the Shift key and 
select all points over which you want the loop, then click Set and type in 
the loop- back time-if you don't provide one, you'll hear a click. Sustain 
loops are indicated by bright red lines. 
<p>
<p>The same technique can be used for release loops. Just click the Rel 
radio button instead of the Sus radio button. 
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B> To delete a point, Option-click it. <BR>
<p>

<LI>To set a Release Jump Point, select a point and click on the Set box 
in the RJP area. The letters "rp" next to the point indicate you have set 
it. Note that the point will not go away when you clear the RJP, but the 
letters disappear. 
<p>
<LI>In most cases, you will also want to set the FLS bit. 
<p>When an envelope or sample finishes, if the FLS bit is set, then the 
instrument is considered finished and it will be stopped. Once stopped, 
the instrument is more eligible to be used by other voices. For example, 
if you have three envelopes on one instrument: pitch, filter, and 
amplitude, the sound is considered over only when the amplitude goes to 
zero. You should therefore set the FLS bit in the amplitude envelope but 
not in the others.

<H2>Tips and tricks for working with envelopes</H2>
This section contains tips and tricks for working with samples. These tips 
were provided by 3DO developers who worked with ARIA during its Beta 
period. <P>
<UL>
<H3>Sustain and release loop points</H3>
The aiff file format supports two loops: sustain loops and release loops. The audio folio takes 
advantage of this by interpreting the first set of loop points as the 
sustain loops and the second set as the release loop. These loop points 
can be set to be the same, cover separate data, or mark overlapping data 
in the sound file.<BR>
Most audio applications support the first set of loop points but not 
the second. You can, however, use SoundDesigner to edit the sound file and 
set loops. SoundDesigner does not support sustain loops and release loops 
explicitly, but if you use "loop 1" as the sustain loop and "loop 2" as 
the release loop, things will work. The loop points show up in SoundHack 
if you want to adjust them further.
<H3>Heuristics for using loop points</H3>
Remember that loop points have to be set on 
even-numbered samples for the audio folio to play them back correctly. <BR>
When preparing loop samples, keep the 
loops short and set both the sustain and release loops to the same point. 
This results in a relatively small sample file. Remember that if a release 
loop is set in the sample, you probably have to use an ARIA instrument 
with an envelope that contains a release jump point to play back the 
sample correctly. 
<H3>Samples and dsp ticks</H3>
In some cases, the DSP may not have 
enough ticks available to handle all the notes with envelopes it is asked 
to play. To remedy this, the following trade-off can be made: First, 
substitute sampler.dsp instruments (the default) for ARIA instruments 
where feasible. Doing this means removing release loop points in the 
affected aiff files-these are identical to the sustain loops-and then 
adding release data to the sample after the sustain loop data occurs. The 
release is generally a few iterations of the data found in the sustain 
loop that are faded out quickly. This means that the compiled instruments' 
data take up more memory (because of the extra release data) but save on 
ticks due to the lack of an envelope generator in the instrument. Since 
this solution requires more memory, it is not optimal, but it does cut 
down the number of ticks used fairly well.

<H3>Building an envelope for a patch</H3>
<p>There is currently no rate-scaling for envelopes built into the audio 
folio or into ARIA. The shape and duration of an envelope therefore always 
stays fixed, no matter how far a sample played into it gets transposed up 
or down from its original pitch. This is not quite how instrumental sounds 
behave in the real world. 
<p>There is not necessarily any correlation between the loop points set 
in the aiff sample file and the sustain loop set in the envelope. They are 
set independently and are not compared during compilation; it is up to you 
to make sure that the two sets of points work together in a useful manner.
<p>In an envelope, the Release Jump Point is jumped to when a Note-Off 
command is received, but in an aiff file with a sustain loop, the data in 
the loop is played to the end when a Note-Off is received before going on 
to play any data beyond the loop. Therefore, in playing an instrument that 
contains both an envelope with a sustain loop and an aiff file with loop 
points set in it (particularly if the loop is long), it is possible that 
an envelope could close down a note before any release data is played or 
even before the current iteration of the data in the sustain loops 
finishes playing.
