<H1><LINK NAME="XREF25707"></LINK><LINK NAME="XREF28535">Setup for working with MIDI</LINK></H1><HR>
This section explains some system setup for working with MIDI. It is 
recommended you go through the setup now even if you don't expect to work 
with MIDI immediately.<P>
<A NAME="XREF38788"><H2>Files and folder setup</A></H2>
If you expect to use samples to play MIDI, you need to copy some files 
into folders that ARIA creates the first time it launches successfully. <P>
To move the files and folders, go through these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>In the <I>/remote</I> folder, locate the following folders which ARIA 
has created: 
<p>
<DL>
<DD>
<UL>
<LI><I>/remote/ARIA/Instruments</I>
<LI><I>/remote/ARIA/Samples</I>
<LI><I>/remote/ARIA/MIDI</I>
</UL><BR>
</DL>
<p>
<LI>Drag the contents of the </I><I>ARIA MIDI Examples</I> folder into the 
new<I> MIDI </I>folder. 
<p>
<LI>Drag any samples from the Toolkit CD-ROM that you expect to use to the 
<I>Samples</I> folder. 
</OL>
<H3>How ARIA uses the folders</H3>
When ARIA compiles patches, it creates files it places in the<I> 
Instruments</I> folder. ARIA also places a file there each time you save a 
patch as a Macintosh document. You can open the Macintosh document for 
further work with ARIA but have to use the file in the <I>Instruments</I> 
folder to play on the 3DO Station. <P>
<H2>Required files for real-time MIDI</H2>
If you intend to use ARIA to create patch documents for making sound 
effects or to play back standard MIDI files from disk, the folder 
structure described above is sufficient. <P>
If you want to create music using ARIA's real-time MIDI capabilities, you 
also need the following: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Apple MIDI manager, including PatchBay, and the Apple MIDI driver, if 
it is needed by the sequencer. Apple MIDI manager is available from the 
Apple Developer's Association (1-800-282-2732).
<p>
<LI>A MIDI sequencer compatible with MIDI Manager, as described in <A 
HREF="./sdt4frst.html#XREF34368">Creating MIDI Projects with ARIA</A>.
<p>
<LI>A MIDI keyboard.
</UL>
<A NAME="XREF11430"><H2>Setting up for MIDI</A></H2>
For real-time MIDI playback from a sequencer, or to play a patch from a 
MIDI keyboard, you will need the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Apple MIDI Driver in your <I>System</I> folder. 
<LI>Apple MIDI Manager in your <I>Extensions</I> folder.
<LI>PatchBay application. Consider placing it in your <I>Apple Menu 
Items</I> folder for easy access. 
</UL>
These programs are available separately and are usually bundled with 
sequencer applications. <P>
Figure 1 below shows the PatchBay window set up for all possible uses with 
ARIA.<P>
The individual connections have the following effect:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Serial port to sequencer-used for composing with your sequencer.
<LI>Sequencer to ARIA-real-time playback from sequencer.
<LI>Serial port to ARIA-playback of patches from MIDI keyboard.
</UL>

<B>Warning: </B>If you are using all three of these connections, consider 
turning off the keyboard "tru" option in the sequencer to avoid "note 
bounce." <P>
