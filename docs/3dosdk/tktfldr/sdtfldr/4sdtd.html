While ARIA is useful for playing MIDI files on a 3DO Station, you will find it even more helpful for editing MIDI files in real-time. Since the actual process of editing the MIDI files depends on the sequencer you have available, this section only gives a brief overview of the process:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Connect the Output of the MIDI sequencer to the Input of ARIA, using the Apple MIDI Manager's PatchBay application. 
<p>
<LI>Load the MIDI file you want to edit into the MIDI sequencer (or start composing a new document).
<p>
<LI>Make sure a MIDI project document is the topmost document in ARIA. 
<p>
<LI>Make sure there is a PIMap in the MIDI project window and that the PIMap is loaded into 3DO memory (see <A HREF="./4sdtc.html#XREF41645">Playing a MIDI file on the 3DO Station</A>.)
<p>
<LI>You do not need to attach a MIDI file to the MIDI project document; MIDI is interpreted in real-time from the sequencer or keyboard. 
</UL>
<DL>
<DD><B>Note: </B>Running real-time MIDI is more reliable if the MIDI Manager Patchbay application is up and running before any of the other programs are launched.<BR>
