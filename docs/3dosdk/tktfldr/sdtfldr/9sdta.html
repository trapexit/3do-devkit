The 3DO Company provides developers with several different audio tools: <P>
<H2>SoundHack</H2>
SoundHack provides, among other things:<P>
<UL>
<LI>AIFF-C format files
<LI>3DO 2:1 compression
<LI>ADPCM 4:1 compression in Intel/DVI format
<LI>decryption of 3DO Content Library sound files 
<LI>dialog box editing of the AIFF instrument and marker chunks
<LI>sample rate conversion (for example 44.1 kHz to 22.05 kHz)
<LI>time stretching and pitch adjustments
<LI>binaural filter spatialization
<LI>convolution between two samples
</UL>
<H2>SquashSound</H2>
SquashSound is an MPW tool that compresses sound files using the 2:1 3DO format. It uses the same algorithm as SoundHack but is useful for batch processing files.<P>
<H2>ARIA</H2>
The ARIA tool (Assembler for Real-time Interactive Audio) lets nonprogrammers create audio content, that is, sound effects and music, for the 3DO Station. You can create and use audio folio instruments using an interactive graphic user-interface and hear the result in real time on the 3DO Station. Specifically, you can: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Design audio folio instruments by using a graphic interface for patching together functional blocks of dsp code. 
<p>
<LI>Create music in real time by connecting your favorite MIDI Manager compatible sequencer to the ARIA tool and hearing your music on the 3DO platform while composing it. In effect, you can turn your 3DO Station into a MIDI synthesizer.
</UL>
<H2>PatchDemo</H2>
PatchDemo is a program that runs on the 3DO development system. It lets you experiment with DSP instruments in a fast and interactive way. Use this program to listen to and prototype complicated DSP instrument configurations for later use in a program. <P>
