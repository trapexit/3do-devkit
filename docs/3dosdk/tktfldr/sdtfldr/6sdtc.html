<H2>Show Output command</H2>
Displays a window to show your sound whenever SoundHack writes sound to your output sound file, except during file copying and normalization. This slows down processing somewhat.<P>
<H2>Show Spectrum command</H2>
Draws the spectrum of the sound file as it's being generated.<P>
<H2>Pause Process command</H2>
Lets you pause during a long process in order to use your Macintosh without starting the processing over. If you are running a convolution, it may take a while-up to three minutes-to pause.<P>
<H2>Continue Process command</H2>
Resumes processing where you left off.<P>
<H2>Stop Process command</H2>
Kills the currently running process and closes the output sound file.<P>
