<H1><LINK NAME="XREF25707">Starting ARIA</LINK></H1><HR>
Aria currently has a two-step startup, described here:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#XREF37656">Setting up the 3DO Debugger</A>
</UL>
The 3DO Debugger takes care of communication between ARIA on your 
Macintosh and the 3DO Station. You have to set it up correctly before you 
can start ARIA.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#XREF22951">Setting up ARIA</A>
</UL>
<B>Note: </B>When you start ARIA for the first time, it creates a number 
of files and folders on your hard disk. If you expect to use samples to 
play MIDI, you also have to move some files and folders into those newly 
created folders, as discussed <A HREF="./2sdtb.html#XREF25707">Setup for 
working with MIDI</A>. <P>
<H3>Debugger version requirement</H3>
To successfully work with this version of ARIA, you have to use the 
Debugger from the Toolkit 1.4 CD-ROM or a later version. <P>
<A NAME="XREF37656"><H2>Setting up the 3DO Debugger</A></H2>
It is currently not possible to use ARIA without the 3DO Debugger, since 
the Debugger is responsible for communicating between the Macintosh and 
the 3DO Station. <P>
<OL>
<LI>Launch the Debugger. 
<p>
<LI>Choose one of the default scripts in the <I>3DO:3DO_OS:version:</I> 
folder, depending on the hardware and monitor you are using. 
<p>
<LI>If the words "Not Executing" appear in the menu bar (Debugger 1.9) or 
in the notification window (Debugger 2.0), release the operating system by 
typing Command-G. 
<p>
<LI>If you wish, close some of the debugging windows to avoid clutter. You 
should only need the Debugger Terminal window.
</OL>
<A NAME="XREF22951"><H2>Setting up ARIA</A></H2>
To set up ARIA, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<p>
<LI>With the Debugger running, double-click on the ARIA icon to bring up 
the application. 
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B> If you know you won't need to run MIDI Manager 
during this round of development, hold down the M key while ARIA is 
starting up. <BR>
<p>
<p>What happens next depends on whether ARIA launched successfully or 
not: 
<p>
<UL>
<LI>If an error occurs, an alert appears and information about the error 
is written to the ARIA Log window. Follow the instructions in the Log 
window to adjust your system setup. 
<p>
<LI>If ARIA is launched successfully, the following windows appear: 
</UL>
<p>
<DL>
<DD>
<UL>
<LI>The <A HREF="./3stda.html#XREF37885">Block palette</A> gives access to 
the tools you can use to construct patches. 
<p>
<LI>The large window below the block palette is a patch document window. 
Working with patches is discussed in <A 
HREF="./sdt3first.html#XREF36060">Creating Patches with ARIA</A>.
</UL><BR>
</DL>
