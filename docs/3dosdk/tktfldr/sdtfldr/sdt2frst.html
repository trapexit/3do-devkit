ARIA is a Macintosh application for sound designers, not for programmers.  It lets you:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Construct new 3DO instruments graphically in a patch window
<p>
<LI>Set up a MIDI project window and use it to play back and debug MIDI files from disk on the 3DO
<p>
<LI>Set up a MIDI project window and use it to get the 3DO Station to respond to real-time MIDI events from a sequencer or keyboard, using sampled or synthetic sounds.
</UL>
An on-screen oscilloscope ("scope") allows you to view the sound on the 3DO screen, and an audio monitor screen lets you monitor DSP resource usage.<P>
You can install the ARIA tool using the Easy Install or the Custom Install option of the installer program on the Toolkit CD-ROM. <P>
After installation, you have to perform some additional system setup explained in this chapter. At the end of the chapter, you also find a brief description of installing ARIA without using the installer program. <P>
