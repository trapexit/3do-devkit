When you play a patch, ARIA lets you observe the output signal with a 
simple oscilloscope on the TV monitor and interact with it using the 3DO 
control pad. To interact with the patch, follow the instructions on-line, 
shown in Table 1: <P>

<H3>Audio Monitor</H3>
During patch playback, the Audio Monitor displays, in real time, usage of 
a number of DSP resources. The display shows the usage at the left as a 
numeric absolute value. A histogram on the right shows the usage as a 
proportion of the maximum available. If a patch is not working because it 
exhausts available resources, this histogram helps you find out which 
resource you have run out of.<P>
<B>Note: </B>Future versions of 3DO hardware may allocate these resources 
differently; use them only as a rough guide. <P>
Here are some of the resources Audio Monitor displays:<P>
<PRE>
-------------------------------------------------------
TKR    |DSP ticks really used at this moment.          
-------------------------------------------------------
TKA    |DSP ticks allocated.                           
-------------------------------------------------------
COD    |Code memory allocated. Note that this can      
       |become fragmented.                             
-------------------------------------------------------
KNB    |Space for storing knob values.                 
-------------------------------------------------------
VAR    |Space for internal temporary variables.        
-------------------------------------------------------
InF    |Number of FIFO channels (for example, for      
       |sample playback).

<A NAME="XREF25253"><H2>Playing patches from the keyboard</A></H2>
A 3DO DSP instrument has three phases: start, release, and stop. When you 
play a patch from the Macintosh keyboard or a MIDI keyboard, the patch is 
started when you press the key, and released when you release it. The 
patch is never <I>stopped</I>, so if you have no amplitude envelope to 
fade out the patch, or if you have an amplitude envelope with a release 
loop that continues to play after the release point, the note continues to 
play until you press another key or the space bar.<P>
ARIA cuts off unstopped notes about 10 seconds after release.<P>
<H3>Using the Macintosh keyboard for input</H3>
While you're playing the patch, you can use the Macintosh keyboard as a 
mini-keyboard to play notes. The second row (q, w, e, and so on) has the 
black notes, the third row (a, s, d, and so on) the white notes on a 
piano. <P>
<H3>Using a MIDI keyboard for input</H3>
To play a patch from a MIDI keyboard, you must install the Apple MIDI 
Driver, MIDI manager, and PatchBay, as described in <A 
HREF="./2sdtb.html#XREF25707">Setup for working with MIDI</A>.<A
