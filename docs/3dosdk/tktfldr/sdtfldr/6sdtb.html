The commands in the Hack menu start the sound file processing. Most of the 
processes involve a lot of calculations, and take time. The focus of the 
application has been on achieving useful and interesting processes, not on 
speedy performance. <P>
<H2>Header Change command</H2>
Use this command to change the sample rate, number of channels, and data 
format of the open file. If you open a headerless file, use this dialog to 
set file information before saving a copy. <P>

<B>Figure 2: </B><I>Header change dialog. </I><P>
<H2>Loops &amp; Markers command</H2>
Use to modify the current sound file's header file, if there is one. The 
dialog lets you:<P>
<UL>
<LI>modify the markers in the header file
<LI>modify a loop in the sound file
<LI>modify information in the header of a MIDI file that lets you use a 
single MIDI channel for different sounds, not just different pitches
</UL>

<B>Note: </B>Since SoundHack uses most of the available memory, your 
Macintosh may appear to be frozen while processing. Have patience. <P>
<H2>Binaural Filter</H2>
Lets you create a stereo file; that is, process a monaural sound file so 
that the result puts the mono signal at a simulated position around the 
head. SoundHack does this by using an HRTF (head related transfer 
function) as a filter. There is a function for each position around the 
head. <P>
Selecting this command brings up a dialog. <P>

<H3>Using the binaural filter</H3>
To use a binaural filter, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Enter the desired position in the Angle dialog box (in degrees) 
<I>or</I> click one of the radio buttons on the outside of the position 
wheel.
<p>
<p>The position wheel shows the head of the listener, nose pointing 
upward. Select the position based on that head
<p>

<LI>To normalize the output after computation-that is, bring it to the 
loudest possible level-check the Normalize box. 
<p>
<LI>Click Process.
<p>
<p>SoundHack has filter functions for 12 positions around the head of the 
listener, but if you enter an angle value between two positions, SoundHack 
mixes the two filters on both sides of the selected value.
<p>
</OL>
<H3>For more information</H3>
The binaural filters are sample rate conversions (for 44,100 samples per 
second) of those used in the dissertation "Control of Auditory Distance" 
by Durand Begault; those conversions are approximations of the averaged 
monaural transfer functions shown in Blauert's <I>Spatial Hearing</I>.<P>
<B>Note: </B>Binaural spacialization only works with headphones.<P>
<H2>Convolution command</H2>
Convolution is the process of multiplying the spectra of two sound files, 
creating a type of cross-synthesis, in which common frequencies are 
reinforced. Convolution takes two sound files: an input file and an 
impulse response file. It multiplies the spectra of the two files, 
producing a new sound file. The sound is processed block by block, with 
each block as large as the impulse response. <P>

<IMG SRC="Figures/Ch6figs/Convolutiondialog.gif" 
ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed">
<P>
<B>Figure 5: </B><I>Convolution dialog.</I><P>
The following Convolution  options are available.<P>
<H3>Length Used</H3>
Specifies how much of the impulse response file to use. <P>
<H3>Kilobytes Needed To Process File </H3>
Estimate of the application memory size 
to set for processing. For large impulse responses-above the default of 
900-you must quit SoundHack and reset application memory size. <P>
<H3>Filter Gain</H3>
SoundHack attempts to automatically scale the amplitude of 
filter gain, but this value is impossible to predict. The Filter Gain 
buttons control the amplitude of the filter gain. Select 24 dB for most 
cases. Select one of the other options to avoid clipping if the input and 
impulse response have similar spectra, since extreme resonances will 
occur. If a clipped output still seems unavoidable, save the output in 
NeXT floating point format, then use the Gain Change command from the Hack 
menu to normalize it back to an integer format.<P>
<H3>Normalize</H3>
Normalizes output after computation.<P>
<H3>Ring Modulate</H3>
Performs a ring modulation (convolution in frequency) 
between two sound files. <P>
<H3>Impulse Window</H3>
Applies a selected envelope to the impulse before 
convolution, resulting in smoother convolution. Desirable for a moving 
impulse response convolution since the impulse response changes for every 
block of samples processed. Especially true for a moving ring modulation. 
A triangular window is best for smoothing; a rectangular window has no 
effect. 
<H3>Moving</H3>
Performs a moving impulse response convolution: A window moves 
through the impulse response file, selecting a new impulse response after 
every block of processing. <P>
Set window size in the Length Used field. The window moves through the 
impulse response file at a rate that ensures that the ends of the impulse 
response file and the input file are reached simultaneously. If the 
impulse response file is longer than the sound file, sections of the 
impulse response file are skipped. It is a good idea to set Filter Gain to 
Low if using the moving impulse-or to save the file in a floating point 
format-because the scaling is fairly unpredictable.<P>
<H3>Example for moving input convolution</H3>
With 10 second input file, a 5 second impulse response file, and Length 
Used set to 1.0 for 1-second impulse response windows, the process looks 
like the figure below:<P>

<IMG SRC="Figures/Ch6figs/EditFunctiondialog.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed">
<P>
<B>Figure 6: </B><I>Example for moving convolution.</I><P>
<UL>
<LI>The first 1.0-second frame of the input file (A) is convolved with the 
first 1.0-second frame of the impulse response file (ab). 
<p>
<LI>The window on the input file is moved 1.0 second forward to B, but the 
window on the impulse response file is moved only 0.5 seconds to bc. Both 
files will finish at the same time. Actually, the impulse response file 
reaches the end first and the last impulse response is zero-padded. 
</UL>
<H2>Gain Change command</H2>
Allows scaling the gain/amplitude of a sound file.<P>

<P>
<B>Figure 7: </B><I>Gain change dialog. </I><P>
Equivalent functions in Sound Designer II and Alchemy are faster, and you 
may prefer to use them. However, SoundHack provides an RMS value for the 
file, and allows a different gain factor for each channel. It also works 
on floating point and \xb5 Law files. <P>
Use Gain Change to do the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Click on Analyze to calculate the peak value, peak position (in 
samples), and RMS values. The gain factors are set to normalize both 
channels independently. 
<p>
<LI>Click on Change Gain to create a new file adjusted by the gain factors 
set. In a monaural file, only the channel 1 information is applicable. 
</UL>
<H2>Phase Vocoder command</H2>
Lets you change pitch without changing the length of the sound file or 
change length without changing pitch. <P>
SoundHack extracts amplitude and phase information for 16-8192 frequency 
bands with a bank of filters. If time stretching is desired, these phase 
and amplitude envelopes are lengthened (or shortened, for time 
compression), and then given to a bank of oscillators with frequencies 
corresponding to the filters. For pitch shifting, the envelopes are 
untouched, and given to a bank of oscillators with frequencies related by 
the pitch ratio.<P>

<P>
<B>Figure 8: </B><I>Phase Vocoder dialog</I><P>
The following Phase Vocoder dialog options are available.<P>
<H3>Bands</H3>
Set Bands to the number of filter-oscillator pairs to use. A large 
number of bands gives better frequency resolution; a small number gives 
better time resolution. <P>
<H3>Filter Window</H3>
Lets  you choose different pre-FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) 
windows for different filtering characteristics. <P>
<H3>Overlap</H3>
Adjusts the size of the filter window (relative to the number of 
filter bands) for analysis and synthesis and thus the sharpness of the 
filter. A large setting (4x) gives the sharpest filter. A sharper filter 
differentiates better between frequencies that are between bands, but 
responds more slowly to amplitude changes. <P>
<H3>Scaling</H3>
Type the scale factor in the Scaling box. Click on the scaling 
pop-up menu to specify time scaling by the length desired, or pitch 
scaling by equal-tempered semitones. <P>
<H3>Time Scale</H3>
Click the Time Scale button if you want time scaling.<P>
<H3>Pitch Scale</H3>
Click the Pitch Scale button for pitch scaling. <P>
<H3>Analyze Only</H3>
Creates a Csound compatible pvoc analysis files. <P>
<H3>Scaling Function</H3>
To change the time expansion factor or the pitch 
transposition factor during processing, click the Scaling Function box, 
then select the Edit Function button that appears. Using the Edit Function 
dialog is described below.<P>
<H3>Resynthesis Gating</H3>
Resynthesis gating refers to how much of a sound the 
Phase Vocoder reconstitutes. It works by breaking a sound down into 
component sine waves, altering the sine waves in particular ways, and 
recombining them into a new sound. This is called "resynthesis." Checking 
Resynthesis Gating lets you set Minimum Amplitude and amplitude Threshold 
Under Maximum, to tell the Phase Vocoder not to try to resynthesize parts 
of the sound that would be inaudible in the final product anyway. This way 
processing takes less time because it skips resynthesizing sounds below 
the amplitude you specify.<P>
<H3>Using the Edit Function dialog</H3>
Use the Edit Function dialog to create control functions. You can draw in 
the function window; set upper and lower limits for the function; clear, 
invert, reverse, smooth, or shift the function; or use simple waveforms 
(up to 100 cycles) as a control function. There is no facility for 
selecting, copying, pasting, or cutting.<P>
If the Time Scale button is turned on the Edit Function dialog shows the 
range of the vertical axis in the top-left box and of the horizontal axis 
in the bottom-left. With the Pitch Scale button on, the boxes show the 
maximum and minimum pitch range. The Time Scale Edit Function dialog 
indicates a wave's time scale; the Pitch Scale Edit Function dialog 
indicates semitones.<P>
The next set of boxes represent default scaling functions, which can be 
modified by drawing or clicking with the mouse in the editing window. 
Also, double-clicking on a function applies it to what's currently in the 
editing window.<P>
The command buttons below offer the following functions:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Clear-Returns to the default, a flat horizontal line
<LI>Reverse-Flips the waveform horizontally
<LI>Invert-Flips the waveform vertically
<LI>Shift-Executes a phase shift according to a number (0-399) you specify
<LI>Smooth-Smooths the waveform very slightly
</UL>
After making selections and adjustments in the Edit Function dialog, click 
Done and then click Process in the Phase Vocoder dialog. An Output 
Waveform dialog shows the wave being processed. When processing stops you 
can play the sound.<P>

<H2>Spectral Dynamics command</H2>
Performs standard dynamics processing (gating, ducking, expansion, 
compression) on each spectral band individually. It has individual 
threshold detection for each band, so that the dynamics process can be 
active in one band while inactive in another. <P>
The process can be limited to affect only a specific frequency range by 
use of a threshold. You can decide to affect only sounds that are above 
the threshold or sounds that are below it. The threshold level can be set 
to one value for all bands, or it to a different value for each band by 
reading in and analyzing a sound file. This sound file's amplitude 
spectrum is used for the thresholds for each band. This is especially 
useful if there is a sound you want to emphasize or deemphasize.<P>
When you choose the command, the Spectral Dynamics Processor dialog 
appears:<P>

<B>Figure 10: </B><I>Spectral Dynamics Processor dialog.</I><P>
The Spectral Dynamics Processor dialog offers the following options:.<P>
<H3>Gate-Duck pop-up</H3>
Lets you select the type of process to use. <P>
<H3>Bands pop-up</H3>
Sets the number of filter bands into which to separate the 
sound. 512 is a good compromise for the number of bands at a 44,100 sample 
rate as each band is about 43 Hz apart and the filters used have a 
(512*2)/44,100- or.023-second delay. This is a pretty good frequency 
resolution (if no partials are closer than 43 Hz) without too much time 
smearing.<P>
<H3>Highest Band /Lowest Band</H3>
Limits the frequency range affected.<P>
<H3>Gain/Reduction</H3>
Sets the amount of gain or reduction for the bands which 
are past the threshold. For compression and expansion, this box becomes 
the ratio.  The compressor and expander hold the highest level steady and 
affect lower levels (also known as "downward" expansion or compression). 
<H3>Threshold Level</H3>
Sets the threshold level.<P>
<H2>Varispeed command</H2>
As a sample rate converter, SoundHack is slower and possibly less accurate 
than Sound Designer II or Alchemy, so this function may be superfluous to 
users who own that software. What SoundHack has, however, is a variable 
sample rate conversion utility (varispeed).<P>
Choose Varispeed under the Hack menu and check Varispeed in the dialog 
that appears. This brings up the Edit Function dialog that also appears 
when Pitch Scale is turned on in the Phase Vocoder dialog (described 
above), and lets you manipulate a waveform to vary the rate over the 
length of the sound sample in the same way you modified the pitch scale 
with Phase Vocoder.<P>

used, and the resultant quality of interpolation/decimation.<P>
<H3>Varispeed box</H3>
Click the Varispeed box to enable the Varispeed feature.<P>
<H3>Varispeed Function</H3>
Clicking the Varispeed Function button displays the 
Edit Function dialog, giving you control over a 10-octave varispeed.<P>
<H3>Vary by Pitch/Vary by Scale</H3>
The Vary by Pitch and Vary by Scale buttons 
allow you to draw a curve for either pitch or scaling factor.<P>
