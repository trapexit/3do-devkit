<P>
<OL>

copy it onto the clipboard.
<p>

Once your PIMap file is in the MIDI project window, you have to tell ARIA 
where to find the MIDI file, then load the PIMap file.<P>
To load the files, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>To locate the MIDI file, click on the MIDI File button in the top-left 
corner of the new MIDI project document and select the MIDI file you want 
to play. 
<p>
<LI>Finally, click the Load PIMap button, which is also in the top row to 
the right of the MIDI File box.
<p>
<p><b>Note: </B>Loading the PIMap and MIDI file takes a while. Progress 
is reported in the Debugger Terminal window. If you bring the Debugger 
Terminal window to the foreground while loading the PIMap, the procedure 
runs more quickly. <BR>
<p>

<LI>When the PIMap finishes loading, click on the Play button in the MIDI 
project box to load the MIDI file.
<p>
<LI>Click the Play button (single arrow) in the dialog that appears to 
play the MIDI file on the 3DO Station.<P>
