<P>
<H3>Switching to the Eye Dropper tool</H3>
If the current tool is the Pencil, Paint Bucket, Line tool, or one of the shape or outline tools, you can hold down the Option key to switch to the Eye Dropper tool. <P>
<H2>Changing character width and baseline</H2>
You can change both character width and character baseline for individual characters from the Character Edit window. <P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Character width-</B>The small arrow at the bottom of the edit region lets you change the character width. For any font, the 3DO FontWriter stores only the pixels delineated by the actual character width for each character, not the area determined by Max Width and Max Height. If you set the width of a character to zero, that character isn't stored in the 3DO font file you save.
<p>
<LI><B>Character baseline</B>-A small arrow to the right of the Character Edit window lets you move a horizontal line to specify the character's ascent and descent, and, in effect, the baseline. 
</UL>
<DL>
<DD><B>Note: </B>To change character width and height globally, reload the font and specify a different height and width.<BR>
</DL>
<H2>Choosing between a character and its shadow or outline</H2>
If you're editing a font containing a separate shadow or outline image for each character, you can choose between editing either the character or the other image using the buttons in the bottom-left corner of the window. At start-up, the actual character is displayed. <P>
