<H1>The Preview window</H1><HR>
The Preview window, shown in Figure 1, permits experimentation with font and shadow/outline colors and with foreground colors anti-aliased against different background colors. A pop-up menu in the top-right corner of the window lets you preview the character, its shadow or outline, and both images combined. <P>
The Preview window appears at actual size by default, but you can resize it as needed. <P>
