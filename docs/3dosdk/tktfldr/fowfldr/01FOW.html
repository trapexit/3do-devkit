<H1>About this document</H1>
<UL>
<LI>Fonts built with the 3DO FontWriter are anti-aliased against the background to improve their appearance on an NTSC screen. You can save these fonts to use on the 3DO Station. 
<p>
<LI>FontWriter offers potentially significant space savings because it lets you create a font that is a subset of a given font, with only the characters needed for your title. 
<p>
<LI>FontWriter gives you many options for changing the style of standard fonts. In addition to applying the usual boldface, shadowed, and outline effects, and so on, FontWriter offers many choices for customization, including the Character Edit window drawing tools.
