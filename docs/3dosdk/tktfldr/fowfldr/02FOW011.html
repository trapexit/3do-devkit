--------------------------------------------------------
<b>Command</b>     |<b>Description</b>                                
--------------------------------------------------------
Set Spacing |Changes spacing between characters and     
and Leading |between lines (leading). In the dialog that
            |appears type in the number of pixels you   
            |want between characters (Character Spacing)
            |or between lines (Character Leading), then 
            |choose OK.                                 
--------------------------------------------------------
Load Subset |If your title uses only a small amount of  
File        |text, prepare a file that contains the text
            |and load it using the Load Subset File     
            |command. FontWriter sets the character     
            |width for all characters not used in the   
            |subset file to zero so those characters    
            |will not be saved when you save the 3DO    
            |font. Make individual characters available 
            |again by using the character-width hook, or
            |make all characters available with the     
            |Recalculate Widths command. Change the     
            |subset file and apply Load Subset File     
            |again. The 3DO FontWriter recomputes the   
            |subset. This command lets you create a font
            |with only the characters your title needs, 
            |effectively reducing the size of the font  
            |file.                                      
--------------------------------------------------------
Recalculate |Recomputes the character width so that all 
Widths      |parts of each character become visible. A  
            |dialog asks if you want to recalculate the 
            |entire character set, or the current       
            |characters. Choose Current Characters if   
            |you're working with a subset font and have 
            |edited some of the visible characters to   
            |make all edits visible for just the visible
            |characters. Choose Entire Character Set if 
            |you're working with a subset font but want 
            |to return to the font using all characters.
            |                                           
--------------------------------------------------------
Get Font    |Displays style and size information about  
Info        |the font.
