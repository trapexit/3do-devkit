Q:  I'd like to make the background of my cel transparent. Can you explain 
how to do this? I'd also like to use true black (RGB 0-0-0) in the cel. Is 
this possible? <P>
A:  How you make the background of a cel transparent depends on whether 
you are using 3DO Animator or the custom plug-ins.<P>
<H3>3DO Animator</H3>
If you're saving a packed cel, you can choose any color that's not already 
in the image as the background color. 3DO Animator automatically paints 
all pixels of the selected background color as transparent. <P>
For more information, see the <A HREF="../anifldr/0anifirst.html">3DO Animator User's Guide</A>.<P>
<H3>Custom plug-ins</H3>
You cannot have true black and transparency if you use the 3DO CelWriter. 
You can, however, use true black if you use the Coded8 CelWriter.<P>
For more information, see the <A HREF="../plufldr/0plufrst.html">3DO Custom Plug-Ins and CCMs</A>.<P>

Q:  How can I resize my art to 320 x 240 for a 3DO image? <P>
A:  You can do this in Photoshop or 3DO Animator: <P>

<LI>Photoshop: From the Image menu, select Image Size. Make sure the 
Constrain Proportions box at the bottom of the dialog box is checked, then 
adjust either the height or width field. This does a pretty good job 
re-sampling the image, but it may require some cleanup for very intricate 
or detailed images.<P>
<LI>3DO Animator: When loading the image, choose Open As instead of Open 
from the File menu. You have a choice of scaling or cropping the image.
