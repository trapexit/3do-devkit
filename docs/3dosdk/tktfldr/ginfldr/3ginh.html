<A NAME="XREF22355"><H2>Loading animations based on variable-size cels 
</A></H2>
Q:  Can 3DO Animator handle animation files with variable-size cels?<P>
A:  If you attempt to create an animation based on pictures of varying 
size, 3DO Animator creates the animation but it distorts all pictures, 
making them the same size as the first. <P>

Q:  I seem to have problems loading QuickTime movies into 3DO Animator. <P>
A:  When you open a QuickTime (.moov) file, a preview dialog is presented. 
You can preview the movie from there and save it as an animation in raw 
format. To load the animation, choose Build an Animation from the File 
menu. <P>
