The following basic types of graphics can be processed by the 3DO 
hardware:<P>
<UL>
<LI>3DO images are pieces of 16-bit static artwork that fit the TV screen 
(320 x 240 for NTSC, 384 x 288 for PAL). Images are usually used as the 
background. In contrast to cels, images can't be moved or scaled, and 
can't use special effects. For more information, see <A 
HREF="./1ginb.html#XREF28674">What are images and cels?</A> and <A 
HREF="./1ginc.html#XREF21687">Working with images</A>.<P>
<LI>3DO cels can start out at any size, since the 3DO hardware can scale 
cels. Cels can have a resolution between 1 bit per pixel and 16 bits per 
pixel. You can create irregularly shaped cels, that is, cels that aren't 
rectangular but have the shape of the object they represent, by making 
parts of the cel transparent. A variety of effects are available, 
including:

<LI>Translucency for ghost effects or to create stained glass windows.<P>
<LI>Enhanced luminance per color to enhance a flashing red light or per 
region to create a radiant creature.<P>
<LI>Reduced luminance to create a shadow or smoke effects.

<LI><B>3DO animations</B> (ANIMs) consist of several 3DO cels. If you understand 
how to use cels, you also understand how to prepare animations. <P>
<LI><B>Fonts</B> can be created with a special tool, the 3DO FontWriter. 
You can generate anti-aliased fonts from any font loaded on your 
Macintosh. While conversion is automatic, you can edit individual fonts if 
needed. For more information, see the 
<A HREF="../fowfldr/01FOW.html">3DO FontWriter User's Guide</A>. 
<P>
<LI><B>Video</B> is currently submitted in a software-compressed form. 
Synchronized video and audio are rendered by a special programmer tool, 
the 3DO DataStreamer. Hardware-compressed video will be available in the 
near future for 3DO Stations and 3DO players that have a special MPEG 
card. For more information, see the 
<A HREF="../vidfldr/01VID.html">3DO Video Processing Guide</A>.
