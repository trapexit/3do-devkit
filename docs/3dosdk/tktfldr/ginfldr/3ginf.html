Q:  I'm having trouble running the <CODE></CODE>MakeCel utility from the 
MPW shell. It comes back with an error stating that it is out of memory 
and cannot swap to a shell (two errors in total).<P>
A:  Try increasing MPW's memory to something really big (30 MB). If 
MakeCel still doesn't work, it's probably not really a memory problem. <P>

<LI>If the large amount of RAM works, start scaling it back until the 
problem reappears. Then bump it back up again. <P>
<LI>If that doesn't work, there may be a bug in MakeCel. Try running it 
with a different image, something small and simple.

Q:  Where can I find documentation for the PPM tools?<P>
A:  Documentation for the public domain PPM tools are provided on-line in 
the same folder as the tool itself. Documentation for the 3DO PPM tools is 
available on-line, in the release notes for Toolkit 1.5 and will be part 
of <A HREF="../../ppgfldr/smmfldr/gspfldr/00PGSTOC.html">Getting Started
