The 3DO Frame Grabber displays a region you specify on your Macintosh desktop on a TV screen. This makes it possible to preview art you're working on, no matter what application you're using. The current  version lets you use the 3DO Artist Card or a 3DO Station. <P>
This appendix briefly discusses using the 3DO Frame Grabber.<P>
