<H1>Feature overview</H1><HR>
The features discussed in this section are available, where appropriate, 
through the entire 3DO PostPro tool. For instance, most actions you can 
accomplish using menus, dialogs, and windows can also be accomplished with 
an AppleScript (tm) command. Similarly, any action that you perform can be 
recorded by AppleScript and used later to drive 3DO PostPro.<P>
<H2>AppleScript and 3DO PostPro</H2>
3DO PostPro makes extensive use of AppleScript. Users with an 
understanding of AppleScript can automate all of the PostPro functions. 
Even novice users can record their actions as they go along, and use the 
generated scripts to quickly automate processes.<P>
<H2>Drag and drop</H2>
3DO PostPro makes use of Apple's Drag &amp; Drop technology, in System 7 
and System 7.5. Many basic actions, such as cut and paste, can be 
accomplished by simple drag and drop. You can also exchange data from 
other programs with 3DO PostPro using drag and drop gestures. These 
concepts are described more thoroughly in the System 7 Pro or System 7.5 
documentation.<P>
<H2>QuickTime and 3DO PostPro</H2>
3DO PostPro supports QuickTime, Apple's Multimedia standard. This 
capability allows data interchange with a variety of existing third-party 
QuickTime-related programs.  <P>
<H2>Modular design</H2>
3DO PostPro is extensible, so new modules that provide additional 
functionality can be added easily. A module can allow you to open and edit 
a new file type, convert a document to another type, or support a new 
hardware platform for data-previewing. <P>
