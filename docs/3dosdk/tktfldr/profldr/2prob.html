Document Windows have these basic parts:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Document Proxy-a drag-and-drop "link" to the document, represented by 
the small icon in the upper-left corner of the window
<LI>Editor (category) list-a list of all the items that can be edited in 
the document 
<LI>Information about the document, shown in the upper-right portion of 
the window
</UL>
 An example of two different Document Windows is shown in Figure 3.<P>
<H2>Document Window editor list</H2>
The editor list in the document window shows you the "concepts" a file 
contains and the data 3DO PostPro is capable of editing. Double-clicking 
on an item in the editor list brings up an editor, usually a window with 
various options, or an image. Editors come in various shapes and sizes, 
and are designed to suit a specific type of data. <P>
For instance, the Attributes category brings up an editor to modify the 
CCB flags for the cel. The Effects category brings up an editor to modify 
PIXC settings for the cel. An example of Document Windows with varying 
editor list categories, is shown in Figure 1.<P>

<H2>Document Proxy</H2>
The Document Proxy allows you to drag and drop a "link" to the file to a 
Workbench. 3DO PostPro displays the document on the Workbench and the 
television monitor. The figure below shows the Document Proxy.<P>
