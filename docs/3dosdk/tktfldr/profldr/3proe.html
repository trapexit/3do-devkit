cels</LINK></H1><HR>
3DO PostPro allows you to display multiple cels on top of an image on the 
Workbench and television monitor simultaneously and layer them. Each cel 
or image has a number. The topmost cel in the layering display shows its 
number in the lower-left corner. You can reorder the layering sequence 
interactively.<P>
This section shows you how to display more than one cel at a time and 
reorder the layering sequence.<P>
