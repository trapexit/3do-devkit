<H1>Using AppleScript for batch conversion</H1><HR>
3DO PostPro supports AppleScript as a batch conversion process utility. 
This allows you to convert many cels from one format to another quickly 
and easily. <P>
<B>Note: </B>AppleScript is a separate program and must be installed on 
your system. You can purchase it copy from an Apple retail 
establishment.<P>
This section first covers how to use a simple script to convert Photoshop 
files to a specified cel type. Later, it covers how to use a script saved 
as an application, or <B>droplet</B>, dragging and dropping files onto it 
for immediate conversion.<P>
Make sure that you have a copy of Script Editor installed on your system. 
You can place it in a convenient location. It does not have to be placed 
in either of the System or extensions folders. Look for the icon shown in 
Figure 1.<P>

<H2>What to expect</H2>
This is not a tutorial on how to write AppleScript scripts, only how to 
apply the scripting language for use with 3DO PostPro for conversion 
purposes.<P>
For information on the AppleScript language itself, see the Apple 
"AppleScript Guide" manual.<P>
<H2>How to use a simple AppleScript</H2>
A basic script for conversion prompts 3DO PostPro to open a file and 
defines the file type to convert it to, giving specifications such as:<P>
<UL>
<LI>bit depth
<LI>coded or uncoded
<LI>packed or unpacked
</UL>
Figure 2 shows a script that opens a single specified file (name and type) 
and converts it to a 3DO cel, 16-bit uncoded, and packed. It then 
instructs to save the converted file in a specific location (folder) under 
a specific name. Lastly, it instructs to close the original file leaving 
it in its original condition.<P>

A slightly more complicated type of script can open many files and convert 
each to its own cel (or image) type, with different characteristics, if 
desired. The following illustration is an example of a script that opens 
several PICT files and converts each to a different 3DO cel type with its 
own specifications and name. Figure 3 shows an example of this type of 
script.<P>

<H2>How to use an AppleScript droplet</H2>
The more complex and powerful script is one saved as an application, 
called a droplet. By adding drag and drop capabilities to this 
application, it gives you the ability to drag and drop files onto the 
droplet icon for immediate conversion. You can drag and drop files one at 
a time, or in groups. Figure 4 is an example of an icon for an AppleScript 
application droplet.<P>

When you drag a group of file icons onto a droplet (application) icon, a 
message is sent to the application containing a list of the files. 
AppleScript intercepts the message and runs the script, converting the 
files.<P>
Double-clicking on the icon opens a window that gives a brief description 
of what the application accomplishes. Figure 5 shows the droplet window 
for the icon in Figure 4.<P>

This particular droplet application converts Photoshop RGB images to a 
specified cel type. The script can also be activated (run) by dragging and 
dropping an alias on to it.<P>
