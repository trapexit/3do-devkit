The Effects editor allows you to modify the PIXC settings of a cel. 
Modifying PIXC settings adjusts special effects in a cel, such as 
translucency. The changes you make in the Effects editor are shown 
immediately on the Workbench and on the television monitor. For background 
information on P-Mode and PIXC settings, see <A 
HREF="../ginfldr/0ginfrst.html#XREF26655">Introduction to 3DO 
Graphics</A>. <P>
This section shows you how to edit a cel's display characteristics using 
the Effects editor. It provides an example for settings that achieve 50 
percent translucency for a cel. <P>
After the walk-through instructions, examples of settings to achieve 25 
percent and 75 percent translucency for a cel are also given.<P>
