The Workbench window automatically appears when you launch 3DO PostPro. It is a place where you can drag and drop cels and images for viewing and editing. When you edit a cel or image while it is displayed on the Workbench, you see your changes interactively, in real-time. <P>
Whatever files are displayed on the Workbench are also displayed on the television monitor. Changes that occur on the Workbench occur at the simultaneously in both displays. Figure 1 shows two cels displayed on the Workbench.<P>

You can display multiple cels on the Workbench simultaneously and change the order in which they are layered on the screen, using the Workbench menu options. The cel that is foremost on the display shows its number in its lower left corner.<P>
<A NAME="XREF37450"><H2>Document windows</A></H2>
A Document window appears for each file you open in 3DO PostPro, even if it is in a format that cannot be displayed on the Workbench. <P>
Drag the Document Proxy onto the Workbench to display a 3DO file on the Workbench, as well as on the television display monitor. Figure 2 shows a close-up of the Document Proxy from the Document window.<P>

Document windows differ according to the file type. Figure 4-2 shows Document windows for a coded-6 cel and an image cel. The coded-6 cel window has several categories listed, while the image does not. The categories with the dots are the ones that are active for that file.<P>
Double-clicking on an active category in the Window list, brings up a related editor. Currently, only the Attributes and Effects editors are supported. These editors are covered in <A HREF="./5proc.html#XREF15383">Editors</A>.<P>
