A Workbench is the functional interface to a piece of hardware, such as a 
3DO Development Station. Through the Workbench, you can use 3DO 
files-cels, images, sounds-in a 3DO environment, and receive valid 
feedback regarding the content or settings of those files. For example, if 
you create a cel with various attributes and effects, you can preview it 
on the Workbench and make corrections as needed. You can watch the changes 
on the Workbench as you make them.<P>
Viewing files on a Macintosh monitor is helpful for discerning pixel 
alignment along the edges of objects. You no longer have to go into 
Photoshop to accomplish this task.<P>
The 3DO PostPro ability to display a file simultaneously on the television 
monitor at the same time it is displayed on the Workbench shows the 
palette differential for NTSC display. You can interactively edit the 
characteristics (CCB flags and PIXC settings) of displayed art files. For 
this information, <A HREF="./pro3frst.html#XREF17406">Opening and Editing Files</A>.<P>
A blank Workbench appears when you launch 3DO PostPro<P>
When you drag a document file onto the Workbench, it is automatically 
displayed. The figure below shows the Workbench display after an image 
file icon has been dragged onto it.<P>

The Workbench can display one 3DO image and multiple 3DO cels. <P>
