The functionality of a new subscriber depends very much on the data you actually want to process. Here are some things the Protosubscriber example code includes: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Routine to process arriving data chunks 
<p>
<LI>Routine to set the status bits of a given channel
<p>
<LI>Routine to return the status bits of a given channel
<p>
<LI>Routine to perform an arbitrary subscriber defined action
<p>
<LI>Routine to close down an open subscription
<p>
<LI>Routine to start all channels for this subscription 
<p>
<LI>Routine to stop all channels for this subscription
<p>
<LI>Routine to flush all data waiting and/or queued under the assumption that we have just arrived at a branch point and should be ready to deal with all new data from an entirely different part of the stream
<p>
<LI>Routine to take action on end of file condition
<p>
<LI>Routine to kill all output, return all queued buffers, and generally stop everything. Should return all channels to pre-initialized state.
</UL>
