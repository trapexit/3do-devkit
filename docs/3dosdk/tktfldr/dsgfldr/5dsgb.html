This section discusses how using the right streamblock size and number of 
buffers can improve performance of your application. In reading this 
section, keep in mind that streamblock size and buffer size <I>must</I> be 
equal: You specify streamblock size in the Weaver script file when weaving 
the stream, but you then have to allocate buffers of the same size when 
playing back the application. If you need to change buffer size, you have 
to change streamblock size and re-weave your stream. <P>

<A NAME="XREF36720"><H2>Streamblock size restrictions</A></H2>
You specify streamblock size in the Weaver script, using the 
<CODE>streamblocksize</CODE> command. When specifying streamblock size, 
follow these general rules: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Streamblock sizes must be an even multiple of the physical block size 
of the device. This guarantees that the file system behaves as efficiently 
as possible. In the case of CD-ROM, the physical block size is 2048 bytes. 
<p>
<LI>Using a streamblock size that is a factor or multiple of 32 KB tends 
to improve performance of the stream because of the caching mechanism in 
the current CD-ROM firmware. 
<p>
<LI>Large streamblocks usually result in a smaller percent of filler but 
may introduce delays in applications that branch frequently. 
</UL>
<A NAME="XREF18129"><H2>Dealing with data rate spikes</A></H2>
The maximum data rate from the CD-ROM is 300 KB/s. Because you have to 
take into account user input and other nonstreaming activities, the 
observed rate for all data has to be even lower. In practice, <I>brief 
</I>periods of data consumption in excess of 300 KB/s are possible as long 
as the average data consumption rate is 300 KB/s or less. The figure below 
shows how the actual rate from CD (dotted line) fluctuates around the 
maximum rate (300 KB/s). While the actual rate is higher than the maximum 
at times, it is usually lower and the stream would probably play with no 
data rate errors. <P>

<A NAME="XREF27693"><H2>Using more buffers to prevent starving 
buffers</A></H2>
The main activity of a program that uses streaming is to fill empty 
buffers with data, hand the data off to subscribers, and empty the buffers 
after the data have been played (see <A 
HREF="./3dsga.html#XREF32484">DataStreamer threads and data flow</A>). If 
data are not placed in a way that prevents bunching up in the buffers, the 
program may suddenly find no empty buffers in which to place the data, or 
no data in the buffers it wants to use for playback. Having more buffers 
makes it easier to process the data as they arrive.<P>
The DataStreamer cannot reuse a stream buffer until it receives a reply 
for every chunk of data it has sent to subscribers. In the table below, 
the SCEL chunk at time 1000 has a duration of 1200 (five seconds). As a 
result, the stream buffer that contains the SCEL chunk is unavailable for 
reuse until the SCEL subscriber has replied that chunk has been played. 
Five seconds pass before the streamer can refill the buffer. <P>

<P>
To avoid the problem of starving buffers, consider working with the SCEL 
subscriber or Text subscriber. They allow for a stream header flag that 
copies a specified chunk out of the stream buffer. You can also use them 
as sample programs for your own customized subscriber. See the 
<I>Attic</I> folder for more information. <P>
