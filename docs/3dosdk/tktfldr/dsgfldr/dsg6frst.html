Subscriber threads process the data the streamer thread delivers. Each subscriber thread accepts and processes only one type of data. The streamer thread sends data to the subscriber threads; your application can then get the date from the subscribers. In the past, developers found it useful to create their own subscriber if they had special kind of data that wasn't handled by available subscribers. <P>
