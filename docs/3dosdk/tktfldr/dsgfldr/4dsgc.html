A new sample application, ShuttlePlayer, performs fast-forward and fast rewind operations using an adapted version of <CODE>DSGoMarker()</CODE>. For more information, see the source code in the <I>Streaming:Examples</I> folder. <P>
<B>Note: </B>The ShuttlePlayer sample application actually represents a different branch in streaming: It has several options to DSGoMarker() that are not found in the base DataStreamer library. See the 3DO Release Notes for more information. <P>
