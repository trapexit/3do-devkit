<A NAME="XREF26572"><H2>Examples for using the DataStreamer</A></H2>
The DataStreamer is useful for all applications that need to play back synchronized data of different types: video, audio, 3DO cels and animations, and so on. <P>
The DataStreamer consists of a library and a number of examples. You can use these examples with minimal modification to stream your data to the 3DO system. Here's a list of examples including names of relevant example programs:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Play a full-screen digital video sequence with sound. (Streaming:<I>version</I>:Examples:NuPlayer)
<p>
<LI>Play a digitized cel animation with sound. (Attic:<I>version</I>:Examples:SCelPlayer)
<p>
<LI>Play a video with multi-channel audio. 
<p>
<LI>Play a simple video while loading data (never say "Please wait").
<p>
<LI>Play a video that allows start, stop, fast forward, rewind, and branch. (Streaming:<I>version</I>:Examples:ShuttlePlayer)
<p>
<LI>Play a video with synchronized text (Attic:<I>version</I>:Examples:TextPlayer)
</UL>
More extensive additions to the available source code make it possible to stream any kind of data you need. For example, if you have a proprietary software compression algorithm, you can modify the DataStreamer to play back video compressed with your codec, synchronized with sound. <P>
<A NAME="XREF33483"><H2>Future development</A></H2>
In the future, you should expect the capability to play back hardware, compressed video (MPEG), and video compressed by other codecs than Cinepak. There will also be more control over timing. <P>
See the <I>3DO Release Notes</I> for more information. <P>
