<A NAME="XREF25750"><H2>Initializing a subscriber </A></H2>
Typically a subscriber allocates any global resources it needs, such as subscriber context blocks, during initialization.<P>
The example below shows the initialization procedure from <I>Protosubscriber.c</I>. <P>
<B>Example 1: </B><I>Initializing a subscriber.</I><P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
/***********************************************************************************
 * Routine to initialize the subscriber. Creates the a memory pool for allocating
 * subscriber contexts. A context is allocated and a new thread started with
 * calls to NewProtoSubscriber().
***********************************************************************************/
long InitProtoSubscriber( void )
    {
    ADD_PROTO_TRACE_L1( ProtoTraceBufPtr, kTraceInitSubscriber, 0, 0, 0 );

    /* Create the memory pool for allocating subscriber
     * contexts.
     */
    ProtoGlobals.contextPool = CreateMemPool( PR_SUBS_MAX_SUBSCRIPTIONS, 
                                                        sizeof(ProtoContext) );
    if ( ProtoGlobals.contextPool == NULL )
        return kDSNoMemErr;

    /* Return success */

    }

Each subscriber requires different initialization actions. If you create a new subscriber, you should, however, use the initialization paradigm in Example 2 so that other developers familiar with the standard subscribers will find it easier to use it.<P>
In addition to the initialization routine, you also need to provide a routine to deallocate things allocated by one-time initialization in the <CODE>InitProtoSubscriber()</CODE> routine. In the Protosubscriber example application, this is done by the function <CODE>CloseProtoSubscriber()</CODE>. <P>
<A NAME="XREF41433"><H2>Creating the subscriber thread</A></H2>
How a new subscriber is created depends on the subscriber. In general, the program has to perform the following actions (see Example 2): <P>
<UL>
<LI>Allocate a subscriber context
<LI>Allocate a signal to synchronize with initialization completion
<LI>Create the subscriber thread
<LI>Wait for completion of initialization, return the signal if initialization is complete
<LI>Make sure initialization was successful
</UL>
<B>Example 2: </B><I>Creating a new subscriber.</I><P>
<CODE>

 * the new context (allocated from the global pool) to it. Creates the message port 
 * through which all subsequent communications between the subscriber and the

<H3>Disposing of all allocated resources</H3>
In addition to an initialization routine, you also need one that gets rid of all subscriber resources that were created. Deleting the subscriber thread should free up all other resources the thread allocated. What is left is the thread's stack space, allocated during initialization, and the context block. In the Protosubscriber example, this is handled by the <CODE>DisposeProtoSubscriber()</CODE> routine. <P>
