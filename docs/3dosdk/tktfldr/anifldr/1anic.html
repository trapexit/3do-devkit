This section first provides some background information, then steps you 
through creating a simple coded cel. <P>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
Coded 3DO cels are indexed into a palette. When you create a coded cel, 
3DO Animator always has to first compute the palette; after that you can 
remap the document. <P>
<H3>Available palette colors for different cel types</H3>
The number of available colors for the palette of a coded cel depends on 
the cel type you select. Here's an overview of the available colors for 
different cels: <P>
<UL>
<LI>8-bit coded and 6-bit coded: 32 colors
<LI>4-bit coded: 16 colors
<LI>2-bit coded: 4 colors
<LI>1-bit coded: 2 colors
</UL>
<H3>Saving coded cels and saving palettes</H3>
When you save a coded cel, 3DO Animator always automatically saves the 
palette associated with it. The 3DO system knows how to use the palette 
information in the file to display the cel on the 3DO screen using colors 
that are close to the original. <P>
If a palette works out well for a cel, you can save and load it using the 
Save Palette and Load Palette buttons in the Functions area of the Set 3DO 
Cel Type dialog, as discussed in the section <A HREF="#XREF38179">Saving 
and loading palettes</A>. This is particularly useful when you're working 
with an animation. <P>
<H2>How to create a coded cel</H2>
To convert 32-bit source art to an 8-bit coded cel, follow these steps: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Launch 3DO Animator and select Open in the New Document dialog that 
appears, then find the file in the file selection dialog and choose OK. 
<P>If 3DO Animator is already open, choose Open from the File menu. 
<P>

<LI>Type 3 to display the Set 3DO Object Type dialog if it's not currently 
visible. 
<LI>From the Cel Type pop-up in the dialog, choose Coded 8.
<LI>Click the Best Palette button in the dialog.
<P>A process method dialog appears. 
<P>

<LI>Choose Optimized Version (3DO). 
<P>3DO Animator computes a palette based on the colors in the source art. 
For an 8-bit coded cel, 3DO Animator creates a palette with 32 base colors 
and 7 shades of each color, as shown in Figure 4. Once the calculation is 
complete, the "best" palette is displayed in the palette grid of the Set 
3DO Object Type dialog. The artwork is not remapped, however, until you 
click the Remap Document button.

</I><P>

<LI>Click the Remap Document button, then select Optimized Version (3DO) 
from the Process Method dialog. 
<P>A second dialog appears, prompting for special mapping parameters.
<P>

<LI>Since you're not currently planning on using Transparency or 
Translucency options, leave the defaults in the dialog. 
<P>3DO Animator creates a new document and names it with an extension 
Coded8.
<P>

<LI>If you're satisfied with the newly mapped document, save it choosing 
Save from the File menu. 

<P>If you're not satisfied, you can edit the palette, then update the 
document, as discussed in <A HREF="./1anid.html#XREF12415">Customizing a 
palette</A>.
