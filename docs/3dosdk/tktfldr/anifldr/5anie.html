<H2>Color menu commands discussed in this section</H2>
The following Color menu commands are discussed in this section:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Replace Colors
<LI>Lock Colors
<LI>Show NTSC Hot Colors
<LI>Remap NTSC Hot Colors
</UL>
Some options in the Color menu are not yet available for animations.<P>
<B>Note: </B> If you modified the palette using Arrange Palette, Sort 
Palette, Reduce Palette, or Switch Palette, the colors in all frames of 
the animation are automatically remapped, if necessary.<P>
<H2>Replace Colors command</H2>
The Studio/32 manual explains how to use the Replace Colors option. 
However, the Replace Colors dialog has been expanded to let you select all 
frames if you want to replace colors globally in an animation (see 
Figure 2).<P>

<H2>Lock Colors command</H2>
When you select Lock Colors, 3DO Animator brings up a dialog that lets you 
lock out colors you don't want to use in a colorizing process. <P>
Start by selecting the colors you want to use; then choose Invert to lock 
out the colors you don't need. If you then display a palette, it only 
contains colors not specified as locked. <P>
<A NAME="XREF40276"><H2>Show NTSC Hot Colors command</A></H2>
When you select Show NTSC Hot Colors, 3DO Animator displays a dialog 
showing each color from the current image or cel whose luminance or 
saturation exceeds the range for "safe" display on an NTSC monitor. Colors 
in the NTSC "hot" range cause display distortion on NTSC screens.<P>
If the current image or cel has 8 bits per pixel or fewer, the hot colors 
are shown on the NTSC hot palette. If the image or cel has 16 bits per 
pixel, the hot colors are marked in the P-Mode buffers.<P>
To remap the hot colors, use the Remap NTSC Hot Colors command discussed 
below.<P>
<H2>Remap NTSC Hot Colors command</H2>
When you select Show NTSC Hot Colors, 3DO Animator displays a dialog that 
lets you remap all colors from the current image or cel whose luminance or 
saturation are in excess of the range for "safe" display on an NTSC 
monitor. <P>

<B>Figure 3: </B><I>Remap NTSC Hot Colors dialog.</I><P>
3DO Animator lets you adjust NTSC hot colors in two ways: by reducing 
saturation or by reducing luminance. Some colors may have to be reduced 
twice to "cool down." If you check the "Repeat till all pixels fixed" box, 
the remapping automatically repeats until all the hot colors are fixed.<P>
To verify that the colors are cooled down, select the Show NTSC Hot Colors 
command again. <P>
