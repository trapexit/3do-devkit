The 3DO palette is located in the center of the Set 3DO Object Type dialog 
box. The array of colors displayed in the palette depends on the cel type 
you select. <P>
No palette is available for uncoded cels, though you can change the 
palette before selecting the cel type and update the document. <P>
An 8-bit coded palette offers 32 different colors. Notice the addition of 
the hue bar above the numbers at the top of the palette. The numbers 
correlate to the hues that appear above them-32 possible colors in all. 
The colors below the numbers are the shades and tints of the hue above. 
The background color appears in the rectangle below the palette.<P>
