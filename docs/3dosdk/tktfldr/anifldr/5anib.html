The 3DO Preferences dialog offers the following options:<P>
<H3>Access 3DO Palette</H3>
The 3DO palette is not the default palette. If you check the Access 3DO 
Palette checkbox, the Access 3DO Palette command in the 3DO Options menu 
is checked by default and you can select the other two commands.<P>
<H3>Extended (Programmers) dialogs</H3>
When checked, a dialog allows programmers to set extended Preferences.<P>
<H3>Save in 3DO Format</H3>
 Check this box to save in 3DO format instead of PICT (the default). <P>
<H3>Save 3DO files packed</H3>
When checked, 3DO Animator saves 3DO files packed by default.<P>
<H3>Save PRE0 and PRE1 in CCoB</H3>
When checked, 3DO Animator saves the two preamble words to the cel control 
block (CCB). The preamble words contain size information. Instead of 
saving a CCB for each frame, you can store the information in the preamble 
words at the beginning of the data.<P>
<H3>Always Save in XOR Mode</H3>
Saves animations in XOR mode. The XOR operation is performed between two 
consecutive frames. The XOR operation performed to frame 1 for all frames 
is not currently supported.<P>
<H3>Display on NTSC Target if Available</H3>
If this option is checked, 3DO Animator displays the files you open on the 
NTSC screen and the Macintosh screen simultaneously, provided you have an 
NTSC screen and an Artist Card. Currently, only the Use Graphic Board 
option is available.<P>
<H3>Default Animations Directory</H3>
Lets you change the default directory for animations that are too big to 
fit into memory. The current default is displayed in the text box. Click 
New Directory to select a different directory.<P>
