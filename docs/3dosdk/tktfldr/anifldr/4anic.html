<H1><LINK NAME="XREF23853">Using the light table</LINK></H1><HR>
The light table allows you to trace over selections from an existing 
document and save them in new document. In traditional animation 
terminology, this is known as rotoscoping. <P>
Below, you can see one frame of the original document (from a QuickTime 
movie) and one frame from the new, created by tracing over the first 
document. <P>

<H2>About this section</H2>
This section steps you through using the light table to create a sketch 
from a movie. The procedure has the following parts: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Loading the original animation. 
<LI>Bringing up the light table and linking it to another document. 
<LI>Drawing over the part you want to move to the other document on each 
frame of the movie. 
<LI>Saving the copy for later use, either as a selection or as a separate 
animation. 
</UL>
<B>Note: </B>The different options in the Light Table dialog are explained 
in <A HREF="./ani5frst.html#XREF35882">Menu Commands and Dialogs</A>. <P>
<H2>How to create a new animation with the light table</H2>
To use the light table for creating an animation from a movie, follow 
these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Load the original animation and move to the first frame from which you 
want to copy. <P>

<LI>From the Anim menu, choose Light Table, then Show the Light Table from 
the submenu. 
<P>3DO Animator brings up the Light Table dialog and the light table. By 
default, the light table is on top of the document and is opaque. 
<P>

<LI>In the Light Table dialog, select the Transparency option to let the 
document shine through. 
<P>The light table becomes transparent and the document becomes visible. 
Keep in mind that if you now draw on top of the document, you are actually 
drawing on the invisible light table. 
<P>

<LI>In the Light Table dialog, select Link To Another Document. 
<P>3DO Animator brings up a document the size of the original. If you now 
draw on the light table, which is on top of the original, the drawing is 
stored in the new document. 
<P>

<LI>If you are planning to draw in a color similar to the original-for 
example, sketch out a black dancer using a black pen-consider making the 
document appear lighter by using a filter. Move the Filter scroll bar to 
the right to lighten up the view of the document. <P>
<LI>Choose an appropriate brush and draw onto the first document. You may 
find it necessary at times to enlarge the view of the document. <P>

<LI>Note that the linked document only updates when you select it. <P>
<LI>When you have finished drawing on all the frames you need, you can 
select the linked document and play the sketch animation you created. <P>
<LI>Save the newly created document under a new name.<P>
<LI>Don't forget to release the light table before you quit.
