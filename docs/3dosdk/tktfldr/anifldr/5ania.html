<H2>New command</H2>
When you select New from the File menu, 3DO Animator displays the New 
document dialog (see Figure 2) that lets you specify size, dimensions, and 
other characteristics of the new document. The defaults displayed in the 
dialog depend on the current Preferences settings. Preferences settings 
are discussed in the Studio/32 manual. <P>

<P>
Provides a selection of file formats from which you can choose. The File 
window in the dialog shows only files that are in the format you have 
checked.<P>
3DO Animator supports the following formats:<P>
<UL>
<LI>PICT<B>-</B>Macintosh file format for exchanging files between 
different paint programs.
<LI><B></B>VDAN<B>-</B>3DO Animator-specific format for 8-bit to 32-bit 
animations.
<LI><B></B>S1AN<B>-</B>Animations from Studio/1.
<LI>MooV<B>-</B>QuickTime movie files.
<LI>ILBM<B>-</B>Animations from Deluxe Paint Amiga or ILBM pictures. 
<LI>TIFF<B> </B>(Tag Image File Format)<B>-</B>Format supported by most 
scanner manufacturers and page layout programs. 3DO Animator <I>reads</I> 
and <I>writes</I> 8- and 24-bit color, JPEG, and grayscale TIFF files.
<LI>EPSF (Encapsulated PostScript File)-If an EPSF file contains a PICT 
Preview portion, 3DO Animator can read that portion (only). 3DO Animator 
cannot read an EPSF file that doesn't have a PICT Preview portion.
<LI><B></B>MacPaint<B>-</B>MacPaint file.
<LI>3DO<B>-</B>A file in 3DO file format. 
</UL>
<H3>Picture Preview window</H3>
The Picture Preview window displays a miniature 8-bit version of a 
selected PICT or TIFF document or an animation. The width and height (in 
pixels) of the picture appears below the Picture Preview window. If the 
selected PICT or TIFF file was not saved with a picture preview, click the 
Create Picture Preview button to build one. The next time you open that 
file, a picture preview appears in the Picture Preview window.<P>
The Picture Preview window automatically displays reduced versions of PICT 
files. It shows previews of TIFF files only after you've saved them in 3DO 
Animator. <P>
<A NAME="XREF29252"><H2>Open As command</A></H2>
When you select Open As from the File menu, 3DO Animator lets you open a 
PICT or VDAN file and change the dimensions and other characteristics of 
the file as you load it. The new document opens as Untitled.<P>
You can open the document using different dimensions, DPI (dots per inch), 
or number of colors (bit depth). Using Open As is an easy way to open a 
32-bit document as an 8-bit document, for example, or to adjust the DPI so 
the document prints differently. <P>
When you select Open As, 3DO Animator first displays a standard file 
dialog. After you have selected a file, the Open As dialog 
appears.<P>

<IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh5/FileOpenAs.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed">
<P>
<B>Figure 4: </B><I>Open As dialog.</I><P>
The Open As dialog lets you modify the original document using the 
following options:<P>
<H3>Original Settings</H3>
Shows horizontal and vertical dimensions, DPI, and number of colors the 
document can support. <P>
Any of these settings can be changed in the New Settings box.<P>
<H3>Space Adjustments</H3>

<IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh5/SpaceAdjust.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be 
displayed">
<P>
Lets you resize the document and change the depth of the document.<P>
<UL>
<LI>Scale-3DO Animator preserves the aspect ratio of the original 
document. For example, if the original document (image) was 640 x 480 
pixels, and the new document is 400 x 300 pixels, the new document has the 
same 4 to 3 ratio as the original. If the new document does not have the 
same ratio as the original, the program creates an image that preserves 
the aspect ratio (in our example, 4 to 3) and fills the rest of the 
document with white space. <P>
<LI>Fit-Forces (compresses or stretches) the entire original document into 
the dimensions of the new document. If the new dimension settings are not 
the same ratio as the original, some distortion of the image results.<P>
<LI>Clip-Lets you define the size of the document. Before selecting Clip, 
specify the new dimensions of the document by typing in H and V values in 
the Open As dialog. If the new document is much smaller than the original, 
it will be completely filled with what appears at the center of the 
original document. The edges of the original will be lost in the new 
document. You can move the outline to select a different part of the 
original image. If the new document is larger than the original, 3DO 
Animator places the original in the center of the new document and 
surrounds it with white space. 
</UL>
<H3>Memory</H3>
Displays the RAM required by the original document. If you change the 
dimensions of the original, Memory displays the RAM required for the new 
document settings. <P>
<B>Note: </B>Note: This is for PICT files only.<P>
<H3>Number of Colors</H3>
Lets you choose the bit depth for the new document. <P>
You can check Use Dithering when you open a 32-bit document in either 256 
(8-bit) mode, or Thousands (16-bit) mode. The colors available in the 
current palette determine the quality of the dithering. If you open a 
32-bit document and don't change the number of colors, Use Dithering is 
dimmed, because dithering is unnecessary with true color.<P>
The Palette button lets you choose a palette for remapping if you open a 
document using 256 colors.<P>
<H2>Save As command</H2>
When you select Save As from the File menu, 3DO Animator displays the Save 
As dialog. <P>

<IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh5/FileSaveAs.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be displayed">
<P>
<B>Figure 5: </B><I>Save As dialog.</I><P>
The Save As dialog is a standard Macintosh Save As dialog with several 
additional options discussed in below. When the dialog appears, the 
current name of the document (which may be Untitled) is highlighted. You 
can rename the document by typing a new name.<P>
The following options are supported:<P>
<H3>File Type</H3>

<IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh5/FileTypeSaveAs.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be 
displayed">
<P>
Lets you select the file format for the image or cel. The format you 
select becomes the default until you redefine it using the Save As 
procedure. <P>
You can save files in the following formats: <P>
<UL>
<LI>3DO-Cel/Anim-3DO cel or a 3DO animation.
<LI><B></B>3DO-Image/Anim<B>-</B> 3DO image. 
<LI>PICT-Apple's preferred file format for exchanging files between 
different paint programs.
<LI>TIFF<B>-</B>TIFF (Tag Image File Format) format, supported by most 
scanner manufacturers and page layout programs. 
<LI><B></B>EPSF<B>-</B>EPSF (Encapsulated PostScript File) format. If an 
EPSF file has a PICT Preview portion, 3DO Animator can read that portion 
(only). 
<LI>VDAN<B>-</B>3DO Animator animation file format.
<LI>ILBM<B>-</B>Deluxe Paint Amiga format (picture or animation).
<LI><B></B>MooV<B>-</B>QuickTime movie format. The standard QuickTime 
dialog for setting the compression parameters is displayed.<B>Make 
sure the Frames per Second number is set correctly</B>
</UL>
<H3>3DO...</H3>
Only available if you select one of the 3DO formats. You can use this 
button to set a number of flags and other options for the cel you are 
saving. <P>
<H3>Save Anim in Raw Format</H3>
After you have selected the file type (any type but VDAN), you can save 
each frame of an animation separately by checking the Save Anim in Raw 
Format checkbox. 3DO Animator saves each frame under the chosen name with 
the number of the frame as a suffix.<P>
<H3>LZW File Compression</H3>
Only available when you're saving TIFF files. LZW's guaranteed "lossless" 
compression routine can make a file as much as 50 percent smaller than its 
noncompressed version. However, when a file is saved using LZW, 3DO 
Animator takes longer to open and save it.<P>
<H3>No Preview</H3>
Conserves disk space without loss in performance by eliminating the 
picture preview from the save. This is especially useful if you're saving 
a document for use with a HyperCard stack. Since the stack doesn't require 
or support a preview function, any file you save without checking the No 
Preview box would waste the memory required to create the preview. No 
Preview is the default setting for 3DO files.<P>
<H2>Build an Animation command</H2>
When you select Build an Animation from the File menu, 3DO Animator 
displays a file selection dialog. All the pictures in the folder you 
select are displayed in alphabetical order. Select the directory (folder) 
containing the frames included in the animation. Click Select Current 
Directory to build the animation.<P>

<H2>Build an Animation As command</H2>
When you select Build an Animation from the File menu, 3DO Animator 
prompts you for a folder to select (as described for Build an Animation) 
and in addition offers the options of the <A HREF="#XREF29252">Open As 
command</A>  after you have selected a directory.<P>
