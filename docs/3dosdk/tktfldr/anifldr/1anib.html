This section steps you through converting 32-bit source art to a 16-bit 
cel or an image.<P>
<H2>Images in 3DO Animator</H2>
3DO Animator does not offer a separate option for saving images. However, 
if you first resize source art appropriately (320 x 240 if using an NTSC 
display), the 3DO hardware will treat source art saved as a 16-bit uncoded 
cel as an image. <P>
<H3>For more information</H3>
For more information on how to decide which cel type to use, see

<H2>Converting 32-bit source art to a 16-bit uncoded cel</H2>
When you convert 32-bit source art to a 16-bit uncoded cel, 3DO Animator 
has to reduce the colors. You are prompted for the method to process.<P>
To convert 32-bit source art, follow these steps: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Launch 3DO Animator and open the file.

<LI>Type 3 to bring up the Set 3DO Object Type dialog. 
<LI>From the Cel Types pop-up, select Uncoded 16.
<LI>Click the Remap Document button to apply the cel type selection.
<LI>Choose the method to process from the dialog that appears (see the 
figure below).
