There are two ways in which you can apply nondefault cel characteristics 
to a cel:<P>

characteristics</A>
<LI><A HREF="#XREF26503">Creating custom settings for a cel</A>
</UL>
This section walks you through both methods.<P>
<B>Note: </B>The 3DO Animator interface for creating custom settings is 
intended for a team of a programmer and an artist. Documentation 
explaining the flags is found in the <A HREF="../.././ppgfldr/ggsfldr/gpgfldr/00gpg1.html#XREF14194">3DO Graphics Programmer's Guide</A><P>
<H2>Loading previously prepared cel 
characteristics</A></H2>
At times, you may want to use cel characteristics for several cels.To do 
that, you can save them in one cel, then load them into another cel 
following these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>From the 3DO Options menu, select Set CCB. 
<P>The Load CCB Settings dialog appears.
<P>

<LI>Click the Load CCB Settings button and select the file whose settings 
you want to use from the dialog that appears. 
<P>The CCB settings are automatically loaded and the file name appears in 
the CCB Loaded box.
<P>

<LI>Before you click OK, you still have the option of loading another 
file's settings. Once you have the file and settings you want, click OK.

<A NAME="XREF26503"><H2>Creating custom settings for a cel</A></H2>
Creating custom settings is a task the programmer and the artist working 
on a title should do together. A new tool that allows programmers to 
change the different cel characteristics interactively is under 
development:<P>
To create custom CCB settings, follow these steps. <P>
<OL>
<LI>In the Save As dialog, click the 3DO button. 
<P>The Cel Parameters dialog appears.
<P>The dialog provides access to other dialogs so you can define cel 
parameters. You cannot change the cel type, but you can set everything 
else.
<P>

<LI>To save copyright, description, keyword, and credit information, check 
the related checkboxes and enter the information in the appropriate text 
boxes at the bottom of the dialog.<P>
<LI>To set CCB flags, click the Flags button at the top of the 3DO Cel 
Parameters dialog. 
<P>The CCB Flags dialog appears (see Figure 1).
<P>Each checkbox in the CCB Flags dialog corresponds to a flag for the 
cel control block (CCB) for the cel you are creating. In most cases, the 
Packed, BGND, and NOBLK options are the only relevant flags. For a 
detailed explanation of each of the flags, see the <A 
HREF="../.././ppgfldr/ggsfldr/gpgfldr/00gpg1.html#XREF14194">3DO Graphics Programmer's 
Guide</A>.<P>

<LI>Set the flags as you like, and choose OK.
<P>You are returned to the 3DO Cel Parameters dialog. 
<P>

<LI>If desired, set options in the first preamble word, by clicking the 
PRE0 button in the 3DO Cel Parameters dialog. 
<P>The preamble identifies the type of data in the source data: packed or 
unpacked, coded or uncoded, the number of bits per pixel, and more. This 
information tells the cel engine how to process the cel source data. VCNT, 
Uncoded, REP8, and BPP are automatically set by the 3DO Animator.
<P>

<LI>If desired, set options in the second preamble word by clicking the 
PRE1 button in the 3DO Cel Parameters dialog.
<P>The Horizontal Pixel Count (TLHPCNT) and WOFFSET are set automatically 
by 3DO Animator.
<P>

<LI>To save the cel settings, click Save CCB Settings in the Load CCB 
Settings dialog and you're done.
