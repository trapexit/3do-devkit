<H1><LINK NAME="XREF12880">Creating an irregularly</LINK> shaped cel</H1><HR>
You'll want most cels to be the shape of the object that moves on the 
screen, and not simply rectangular. This section steps you through 
creating a packed and an unpacked irregularly shaped cel. Both processes 
work by using a special background color that will then become transparent 
when the cel is displayed via the 3DO system. <P>
<B>Note: </B>When creating a packed irregularly shaped cel, you can use a 
background color of your choice. When creating an unpacked irregularly 
shaped cel, you have to use black as a background color and have to change 
all black to almost black. <P>
For information on the characteristics of packed and unpacked cels, see 
<A HREF="../ginfldr/0ginfrst.html">Introduction to 3DO Graphics.</A>  <P>
<H2>Creating a packed irregularly shaped cel</H2>
This section steps you through creating a packed, irregularly shaped 8-bit 
coded cel. The procedure has three parts: <P>

<A NAME="XREF41420"><H3>Creating a cel</A></H3>
Before you can create an irregularly shaped cel, you need a rectangular 
cel to start with. Follow the steps in <A 
HREF="./1anic.html#XREF38335">Creating a simple coded cel</A> to create an 
8-bit coded cel. <P>
<A NAME="XREF39753"><H3>Filling the background with the background 
color</A></H3>
After you have prepared the cel, you need to make the area around the cel 
object (the background) transparent. <P>
To fill the background with the background color, follow these steps:<P>

1. Follow these steps to tear off the paint palette (see Figure 1): 
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Point to the color patch that displays the current paint palette color.
<LI>Position the pointer at the edge of the palette.
<LI>Drag the palette to the desired location on the screen.
</UL><BR>
</DL>

<B>Figure 1: </B><I>3DO Animator tear-off palette.</I><P>

2. Find a color in the palette that is not in the document by clicking on 
colors in the tear-off palette. <P>

If a color you click in the paint palette flashes in the cel, it is 
being used and you should select another color. For this to work, you 
should be using an 8-bit cel. <P>
<B>Note: </B>The flashing does not currently work on all monitor 
types. <BR><P>

3. Once you've selected a color in the paint palette that is not being 
used, click in the background area using the Magic Wand tool.<P> 

4. Select the Fill tool (paint bucket) and click in the background area. <P>

The background color fills the selected background area and appears as 
the current color in the paint palette color patch.<P> 

5. In the Set 3DO Object Type dialog, select the Background Color box. 
Select the Color Picker tool (eye dropper) and click the background area. 
<P>
The color appears in the Background Color box. When you later save the 
cel, all pixels in the background color are marked as transparent, and 
displayed as transparent if the CCB flags are set correctly (discussed in 
the next section). 

<A NAME="XREF21912"><H3>Setting CCB flags</A></H3>
Using a special background color to create an irregularly shaped cel only 
works for a packed cel. This section steps you through setting the cel 
control block (CCB) flags to work with the background color. <P>
<OL>
<LI>From the 3DO Options menu, select Set CCB. 

<P>The Load CCB Settings dialog is displayed.
<P>

<B>Note: </B>If there are CCB settings you want to copy from another file, 
click the Load CCB Settings button and select the file from the dialog 
that appears. Click OK to complete the transfer.<P>

<LI>Select the Packing On box, then choose OK. 
<P>The cel is now saved in packed format.

<H2>Creating an unpacked, irregularly shaped cel</H2>
An unpacked, irregularly shaped cel takes advantage of the 3DO hardware's 
ability to make black (RGB 0-0-0) pixels transparent, provided certain CCB 
flags are set. <P>
If you use this feature, you can't have black (RGB 0-0-0) as part of the 
cel itself, because black pixels in the cel will also become transparent, 
and your cel will have holes. <P>
<H3>About this section</H3>
This section first steps you through creating an unpacked irregularly 
shaped cel by explaining the following procedures: <P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#XREF30311">Creating a cel with no black</A>
<LI><A HREF="#XREF13388">Creating a black background</A>
<LI><A HREF="#XREF35189">Setting CCB flags</A>
</UL>
<A NAME="XREF30311"><H3>Creating a cel with no black</A></H3>
Since you will save the irregularly shaped, unpacked cel using flag 
settings that make black (RGB 0-0-0) pixels transparent, you need to 
replace all black pixels in the cel with almost black (RGB 0-0-8). This 
prevents the cel from having unwanted transparent areas.<P>
To create a cel with no black, follow these steps: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Follow the steps in <A HREF="./1anic.html#XREF38335">Creating a simple 
coded cel</A> to create an 8-bit coded cel.<P>

<LI>Position the tear-off paint palette at a convenient place on the 
screen, as explained above. <P>
<LI>Click on colors in the top row of the paint palette that appear to be 
black (RGB 0-0-0 through RGB 0-0-7) and note which shades between 0-0-0 
and 0-0-7 are included. 
<P>The RGB values of the selected color appear beneath the color bars on 
the Set 3DO Object Type dialog.
<P>

<LI>From the Color menu, choose Replace Colors. 
<P>
The Replace Colors dialog appears.
<P>

<LI>Click the 0-0-0 color in the paint palette. 
<P>
It is moved into the first box in the Old: color grid in the Replace 
Colors dialog.
<P>

<LI>Click the first box in the New color grid in the Replace Colors 
dialog, then click on the RGB 0-0-8 color in the paint palette. <P>
<LI>Click "Replace old with new," making sure you select All the Frames if 
you are working with an animation.<P>
<LI>Repeat steps 5 and 6 replacing colors ranging from RGB 0-0-1 to RGB 
0-0-7 with RGB 0-0-8.
</OL>
<A NAME="XREF13388"><H3>Creating a black background</A></H3>
To take advantage of the hardware facility of displaying black (RGB 0-0-0) 
pixels as transparent, you have to create a black background that will 
form a transparent mask. Follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Click on black in the paint palette to make it the current color. 
<P>Black appears in the palette color patch and defines it as the fill 
color.
<P>

<LI>Select the background with the Magic Wand tool.<P>
<LI>Fill the background with the Fill tool (paint bucket). 
</OL>
<A NAME="XREF35189"><H3>Setting CCB flags</A></H3>
The final step in creating an irregularly shaped, unpacked cel is to set 
the appropriate CCB flags. The CCB flags inform the 3DO hardware of the 
settings for the cel. <P>
<OL>
<LI>From the 3DO Options menu, select Set CCB. 
<P>The Load CCB Settings dialog appears.
