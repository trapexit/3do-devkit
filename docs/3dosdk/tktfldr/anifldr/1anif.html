<A NAME="XREF28809"><H2>How PIXC and P-Mode works</A></H2>
Each cel has a PIXC; which determines some of the cels attributes. By 
default, cels are rendered as opaque, but you can change the PIXC to 
enhance luminance for the whole cel, create a ghost effect by mixing the 
entire cel with the background (making it translucent), or create a 
shadow.<P>
Each cel actually allows for two PIXC settings, allowing you, in effect, 
to make some pixels in the cel translucent (one PIXC settings group) while 
all others remain opaque.<P>
<UL>
<LI>For 8-bit coded cels-you can create special effects on a 
color-by-color basis. For example, you can enhance the luminance of all 
shades of red for the lights of a police car.<P> 
<LI>For 6-bit coded and 16-bit uncoded cels-you can create special effects 
on a pixel-by-pixel basis. First you create a mask, then mix the cel 
pixels in the region of the mask with background pixels to create the 
desired special effect.
</UL>
The two possible PICX settings a cel can choose from are often referred to 
as 
P-Modes. <P>

All pixels in the cel that you want to be translucent-a ghost perhaps-will 
use the P-Mode One setting. The translucent effect is attained by 
appropriately mixing the image (frame buffer) pixels with the cel (cel 
data) pixels. Because of this, the second source must be defined as the 
frame buffer, not zero.<P>
For more information on how the 3DO system hardware can manipulate image 
and cel data to create special effects, see

Graphics</A><P>
<A NAME="XREF24078"><H2>How to enhance luminance</A></H2>
This section explains how you can use per-color P-Mode for an enhanced 
luminance special effect. <P>
<H3>Basics of per-color P-Mode</H3>
With an 8-bit coded cel, you can set the P-Mode on a per-color basis. As a 
result, you can affect pixels of a selected color (or colors) in the cel. 
You can mix those pixels with the background image for translucency 
(stained glass effect), or use a multiplier differently to enhance 
luminance (lights) or reduce luminance (shadow). If you alternate a cel 
with enhanced luminance with one of regular luminance, you can create a 
flashing-light effect when the animation is displayed.<P>
<H3> How to enhance luminance of selected colors</H3>
To enhance the luminance of selected colors in a cel, follow these 
steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Convert source art to an 8-bit coded cel. <P>

<LI>If you wish, assign a background color to create an irregularly shaped 
cel. <P>
<LI>In the 3DO palette grid, shift-select the colors for which you want to 
enhance luminance. <P>
<LI>Click the P-Mode box in the bottom left region of the Set 3DO Object 
Type dialog, then select Make it 1 from the pop-up menu to the right of 
the function buttons. <P>
<LI>From the 3DO Options menu, select Set CCB. 
<P>The Load CCB Settings dialog appears.
<P>

<LI>Click the Translucency Options button. 
<P>The Translucency Options dialog appears.
<P>

<B>Figure 2: </B><I>Translucency Options settings for enhancing 
luminance.</I><P>

<LI>Set up the Translucency Options dialog as follows (see Figure 2): 


<UL>
<LI>Click P-Mode One.
<LI>For the first source, click Cel Data.
<LI>For the second source, click Frame Buffer.
<LI>In the Multiply by field, make sure CCB is selected, then choose 1 
from the pop-up.
<LI>In the Divide by field, make sure CCB value is selected, then choose 4 
from the pop-up.
</UL><BR>


<LI>Click OK to apply the setting.
</OL>
Here's the effect of your settings: By default, the first source is 
multiplied by 8, then divided by 8. If you divide by 4 instead (and still 
multiply by 8), you in effect enhance the luminance. To further enhance 
luminance you can divide by 2. To darken the color for a shadow effect, 
divide by 16 for this option.<P>
<A NAME="XREF19488"><H2>How to define a translucent area in an opaque 
cel</A></H2>
If you are working with a 6-bit coded cel or a 16-bit uncoded cel, you 
have the option of using a per-pixel P-Mode. You can create a mask to mark 
the regions of the cel that you want to be translucent, then select P-Mode 
settings that will make all areas of the cel one P-Mode (for example, 
opaque) and all areas defined in the mask a different P-Mode (for example, 
translucent). <P>
This makes it possible, for example, to mask a window to become 
translucent green, or to mask the eye of a creature for which you want to 
enhance luminance.<P>
<H3>Creating a translucent area</H3>
Creating a translucent area inside an opaque cel consists of two basic 
steps: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Defining the mask 
<LI>Choosing the CCB settings 
</UL>
To create the mask, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Convert your source art to a 6-bit coded cel or a 16-bit uncoded cel.
<P>The cel type you choose depends on the number of colors in the source 
art and the memory you expect to have available: A 16-bit uncoded cel 
allows for thousands of colors but needs over twice the memory of a 6-bit 
coded cel.
<P>
<LI>From the Windows menu, choose Show Mask Panel.<P> 
<LI>Click the Keep Mask button on the dialog that appears. 
<P>This provides the same mask on all the frames. Since you will define 
the translucent area using a mask, this setting must be in place.
<P>

first open the control panel, the is source art is on top, the P-Mode 
draft page underneath.

<LI>From the Goodies menu, select Mask, then choose Mask Selection Only 
from the submenu.<P>
<LI>In the P-Mode control panel, click the Copy Mask in PMode button, then 
click the PMode on Top button.
<P>You should see the area you selected pasted in as a black mask. To 
verify you have masked the correct area, you can make the draft page 
transparent by clicking the Transparency button. </UL>
