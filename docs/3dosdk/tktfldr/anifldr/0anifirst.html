<H1>Audience</H1>
You don't have to be a programmer to work with the 3DO Animator tool or 
with this document. You should, however, be familiar with:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Macintosh interface
<LI>Studio/32 from Electronic Arts
<LI>Basics of the 3DO system
</UL>
<B>Note: </B>To learn about Studio/32, use the Studio/32 document included 
in your package as a separate manual. This document covers only 3DO 
Animator functionality not available in Studio/32. <P>
<H1>System prerequisites</H1>
To use 3DO Animator, you must have:<P>
<UL>
<LI>A Macintosh running System 7, with at least 8 MB allocated to 3DO 
Animator. 
<LI>The QuickTime application in the System folder. 
<LI>If you are using the 3DO Artist Card, you need the 3DO Artist Card 
Driver in the System folder. 
</UL>
<H2>3DO Animator Preferences files</H2>
The first time you launch the 3DO Animator tool, it creates a 3DO Animator 
Preferences file. As you receive updates for the software, make sure you 
remove the old Preferences file and allow 3DO Animator to create a new 
Preferences file each time. You may have problems running the software 
otherwise. <P>
<H2>Memory restrictions</H2>
If an animation becomes too big to fit in the available memory, a dialog 
pops up and gives you the option to work with part of it <B>disk 
based</B>. If you don't want to do that, save everything as is, quit 3DO 
Animator and allocate more memory for 3DO Animator according to your need 
and your available memory. If you choose to work disk based, give the 
volume and the name of the temporary file when requested. A default name 
is proposed, based on the current 3DO Preferences; avoid naming it like 
your original file. 3DO Animator will access this file when needed. 3DO 
Animator tries to work as much as possible in memory and access the 
temporary file only when no more memory is available.<P>
