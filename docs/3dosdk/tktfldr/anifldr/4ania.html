3DO Animator lets you create different transition effects over a series of

animation to another. 3DO Animator transition effects include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Vertical blinds
<LI>Horizontal blinds 
<LI>Dissolve
<LI>Zoom
<LI>Metamorphosis

<H2>About this section</H2>
This section shows you how to use the vertical blinds transition to hide 
an object. You can use the same basic procedure for the other transition 
effects. Keyboard shortcuts are used whenever possible throughout the 
example to speed up the process. <P>
