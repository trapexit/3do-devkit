--------------------------------------------------------
Option         |Description                             
--------------------------------------------------------
Enter The      |Specifies the number of frames for the  
Number of      |animation. The maximum allowed in a     
Frames         |single animation is 999.                
--------------------------------------------------------
Make Number... |Specifies a different first frame than  
The First Frame|frame 1. 3DO Animator reshuffles the    
               |frames to renumber them. This is useful 
               |when you are combining animations.      
--------------------------------------------------------
Duplicate last |If the Duplicate last frame box is      
frame          |checked, 3DO Animator makes every frame 
               |you entered in the top box an exact copy
               |of the last frame of the animation. This
               |is useful when you want a single picture
               |to be the background for a range of     
               |frames, or even for the whole animation.
               |Open the picture and set the number of  
               |frames, and check the "Duplicate last   
               |frame" box. 3DO Animator creates the    
               |number of frames you specified, each a  
               |duplicate of the picture.

<P>
<H2>Show/Hide Control Panel command</H2>
When you select Show/Hide Control Panel, 3DO Animator displays (or hides) 
the Anim control panel.<P>

<IMG SRC="Figures/ANICh5/AnimControl.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be 
displayed">
<P>
<B>Figure 3: </B><I>Anim control panel. </I><P>
The control panel presents frame counter and speed adjustment scroll bars, 
a dynamic display of current memory, Pause and Sound options, range 
buttons, and five control buttons for working through and playing your 
animation.<P>
<H3>Keyboard Shortcuts</H3>
For a summary of the keyboard shortcuts you can use with these controls, 
see the quick refererence card that is part of you documentation set.<P>
<H2>Anim control Panel options</H2>
<H3>Disk space indicator</H3>
The disk space indicator in the upper-left corner of the panel displays 
the amount of disk space still available and gives an estimate of the disk 
space needed to save the animation.<P>
<H3>Frame counter</H3>
Displays the current frame's number and the total number of frames in the 
animation. To move to a specific frame, drag the scroll bar or click the 
Next Frame or Previous Frame button. <P>
If you are working with key frames and the current frame is a key frame, a 
small key is displayed between the number and the scroll bar. In that 
case, you can advance from one key frame to the next by using 
Option-clicks. <P>
<H3>Speed adjustment bar</H3>
Displays the speed at which the current animation will play in frames per 
second (fps). The default setting is 30 fps. The default range is between 
1 and 60 fps. To change the playback speed of an animation (while the 
animation is <I>not </I>playing), drag the slider to the left (decrease) 
or to the right (increase). <P>
To set the fastest possible playback speed for your animation, drag the 
sliding control to the far right so that black fills the scroll bar. This 
sets the playback speed at infinity. <P>
To change the playback speed of the animation while it is running, press 
the + or - key on the numeric keypad to increase or decrease the speed of 
the animation by one frame per second each time you press the key. Hold 
either key down for continuous change in that direction.<P>
<H3>Pause button</H3>
Lets you adjust the length of time a selected frame is on screen as your 
animation plays. Settings made through the Pause control override settings 
in the Speed control. <P>
Move to the frame you want to pause on, and click the Pause button. In the 
Pause On Frame dialog, enter the number of seconds you want that frame to 
appear on the screen and Click OK. The number you entered appears in the 
control panel next to the Pause button.<P>
You can set a pause on as many frames as you like, but you must set it one 
frame at a time. <P>
<H3>Sound button</H3>
Lets you add sounds to an animation. Sound is linked to a specific frame 
and plays as the frame plays. You can add sounds one at a time to as many 
frames as you like (one sound per frame), however, many sounds slow down 
the playback speed. <P>
Sounds with a short play period (large files) work best. Sustained sounds, 
or sounds on several consecutive frames, tend to get clipped and distorted 
when played back. <P>
<H3>Range buttons</H3>
If you click one of the Range buttons, 3DO Animator displays the Set Frame 
Range dialog. A range can be any contiguous number of frames. Enter 
starting and ending frame numbers when you want to work on just a range of 
frames or when you want to save a range of frames (see the description of 
the Save Range command later in this chapter).<P>
When you enter a range of frames, all animation playback commands in the 
Anim control panel are affected. Play Once, Play Continuously, and Play 
Ping Pong will work only on the range of frames entered in the boxes.<P>
<H3>Previous frame button (Command-2)</H3>
Click to move backward one frame. If the current frame is the first frame 
in the sequence, this button moves the animation to the last frame. <P>
<H3>Next frame button (Command - 3)</H3>
Click to move forward one frame. If the current frame is the last frame in 
the sequence, this button moves the animation to the first frame. <P>
<H3>Play once button (Command - 4)</H3>
Click to play through an animation sequence one time (at the speed set in 
the frame counter), from frame 1 to the last frame. Option-click takes key 
frames into account-that is, it tries to complete a sequence in the 
specified time by skipping from one key frame to the next if possible.<P>
<H3>Play Continuously button (Command - 5)</H3>
Click to play an animation sequence continuously at the speed set in the 
frame counter. Press any key or the mouse button to stop.<P>
<H3>Play Ping Pong button (Command - 6)</H3>
Click to play an animation sequence continuously, but the button plays the 
sequence forward, then backward, then forward, and so on. Press any key or 
the mouse button to stop.<P>
<H2>Go to Frame command</H2>
Prompts you for the frame you want to reach. <P>
<H2>Key Frames command</H2>
When an artist creates an animation, only the key frames contain full 
information about the picture. Other frames only know about the 
differences. <P>
The submenu of the Key Frames command allows you to access key frames 
directly without going through intermediate frames.The following commands 
are available.<P>
<H3>Set Current As Key Frame</H3>
Saves the full image for the current frame and defines it as a key 
frame.<P>
<H3>Set Key Frames</H3>
Sets key frames at regular intervals in the animation.<P>
<H3>Cancel Current Key Frame</H3>
If you select this command, the current frame won't be saved as a full 
image any more.<P>
<H3>Cancel All Key Frames</H3>
Removes all key frame markings.<P>
<H2>Append command</H2>
When you select Append, 3DO Animator displays the standard file selection 
dialog, with a Picture Preview window for PICT or VDAN files.<P>
Choose a file and click Open to add that file to the end (after the final 
frame) of the current animation. You can only append a PICT or VDAN file, 
and it must be the same size as or smaller (in total horizontal or 
vertical dimensions) than the file you're appending it to. If you try to 
add a larger file, an error message is displayed. <P>
<H2>Save Range command</H2>
When you select Save Range, 3DO Animator lets you cut large animations 
into smaller pieces and use the pieces in other animations. It displays 
the standard Save As dialog but saves only the current range of frames 
from the current animation. <P>
Before choosing this command, you must set the range using the Set Frame 
Range dialog, which appears when you click one of the range buttons in the 
Anim control panel.<P>
<H2>Delete command</H2>
When you select Save Range, 3DO Animator displays a submenu for deleting 
frames from your animation. <P>
<B>Caution: </B>You can't choose Undo after using one of the Delete 
commands. Before you choose one of these options, make sure that you want 
to delete-that is, remove a frame or frames from the animation. <P>
The following commands are available:<P>
<H3>Current Frame</H3>
Deletes the current frame and makes the following frame the current frame 
unless you're at the last frame. <P>

frames you want to delete. Click OK to delete the specified frames from 
the sequence.<P>
<H3>All Frames</H3>
Deletes all the frames in the animation sequence and leaves the current 
frame as your document.<P>
<H2>Insert command</H2>
<H3>One Frame</H3>
Adds a frame after the current frame and copies the contents of the 
current frame to it.<P>
<H3>Frames...</H3>
Displays the Insert Frame dialog. Enter the number of frames you want to 
add to the animation sequence (after the current frame), and click OK.<P>
Check the Duplicate Current Frame option if you want the frames you're 
inserting to be copies of the current frame. 3DO Animator inserts blank 
frames otherwise.<P>
<H2>Clear command</H2>
When you select Clear, 3DO Animator presents a submenu for clearing frames 
and filling them with the background color.<P>
<B>Caution: </B>You can't choose Undo after using one of the Clear 
commands. Before you choose one of these options, make sure that you want 
to clear. <P>
The following commands are available:<P>
<H3>Current Frame</H3>
Clears the current frame.<P>
<H3>Frames...</H3>
Displays the Clear Frames dialog, which lets you enter the range of frames 
you want to Clear. Click OK to clear those frames from your document.<P>
<H3>All Frames</H3>
Clears all the frames in the current document.<P>
<H2>Light Table command</H2>
Provides a draft page with additional functionality for each frame. When

<P>
<B>Figure 4: </B><I>Light Table dialog with light table on top.</I><P>
The options available in the Light Table dialog when the light table is on 
top (the default) are listed in below.<P>
The following commands are available when the light table is on top:<P>
<H3>Light Table on Top</H3>
Brings the light table to the top.<P>
<H3>Document on Top</H3>
Brings the source document to the top.<P>

<H3>Anim Template</H3>
Not supported in this release.<P>
<H3>Anim Distortion</H3>
Lets you distort an animated selection.<P>
For an example, see <A HREF="./4anib.html#XREF20517">Animated 
distortion</A>.<P>
<H3>Anim Effect</H3>
Lets you add transition effects to an animation. The effect you choose 
takes place in a selected area between a starting frame and an ending 
frame, which you specify in the Transition Effects dialog. An effect can 
be added to a stationary selection as well as to a selection you have 
moved with Anim Move or Anim 3D. You can transform any selection or 
selected area of the screen with a transition effect.<P>
For an example, see <A HREF="./4ania.html#XREF30372">Transition 
effects</A>.<P>
<H3>Anim Move (Command-0)</H3>
Gives you a simple way to create horizontal and/or vertical movements for 
the objects you create. You set a beginning point and an end point for the 
object you want to move. 3DO Animator draws the movement of the object as 
a straight line between the two points over the number of frames you set. 
<P>
For an example, see <A HREF="./2anic.html#XREF28890">Using Anim 
Move</A>.<P>
<H3>Anim 3D</H3>
Not currently implemented<P>
<H3>Pickup selection</H3>
Lets you pick up part or all of an animation. You can save an animated 
selection (using the Save As Selection command) and use your creation as 
animated clip art in other animations. <P>
Use one of the Selection tools to surround the selection before choosing 
this command. If the selection changes location during the animation, 
surround the entire animated area with the selection Marquee.<P>
For an example, see <A HREF="./3anid.html#XREF21692">Saving an animated 
selection</A>.<P>
<H2>Process command</H2>
When you select Process, 3DO Animator displays a submenu lets you choose 
the Edge Detection command. This command starts an edge detection process 
on all frames in an animation. As a result, you will have a document that, 
in general, contains clean outlines. The command is only valid for 8-bit 
documents. You can't undo the results of the command. <P>
