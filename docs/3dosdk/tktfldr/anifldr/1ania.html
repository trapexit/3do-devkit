While a 3DO cel can be any size-and can then be scaled during the display 
process-a 3DO image always has to fit the TV screen exactly. <P>
If you want to create a 3DO image (rather than a cel) you may have to clip 
or scale the source art to 320 x 240 for NTSC screens while opening the 
file.<P>
<H3>For more information</H3>
3DO images and cels are discussed in detail in <A HREF="../ginfldr/0ginfrst.html">Introduction to 3DO Graphics</A>  <P>
<H2>How to resize source art while opening a file</H2>
To resize source art while opening a file, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>From the File menu, choose Open As.
<P>
For best results, open art with a resolution of more than 16 bits per 
pixel (millions), at 16 bits per pixel (thousands). Opening an image in 
16-bit color helps prevent NTSC hot colors from occurring.
<P>

<LI>Select the file you want to open and click Open. 
<P>The Open As dialog appears.
<P>

<LI>In the Dimensions area of the dialog, type in an H value of 320 and a 
V value of 240. <P>

<LI>From the Space Adjustments pop-up menu, choose Scale, Fit, or Clip.
<P><B>Scale-</B>Preserves the aspect ratio of the original document in 
the new document. If the new document does not have the same aspect ratio, 
the 3DO Animator tool adds white space. 
<P><B>Fit-</B>Forces the entire original document into the new 
dimensions, which usually results in some distortion. 
<P><B>Clip-</B>Does not adjust the size but centers as much as 
will fit into the dimensions indicated by the new settings.

If you select Clip, you can define the clip parameters in the dialog that 
appears.<P>
