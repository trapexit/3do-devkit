This section first looks at the basic idea behind flip-book type 
animations, then discusses disk space requirements, and lists special 
features of 3DO Animator that facilitate creating animations.<P>
<H2>Flip-book type animations</H2>
The basic idea behind animation is that you paint on multiple pages 
(called <B>frames</B>) and then flip through them. Making images that 
differ slightly from frame to frame and playing them back in rapid 
succession creates the illusion of motion.<P>

<H2>Disk space considerations</H2>
Animations use a lot of disk space because each frame is usually a 
separate file. You should therefore choose the resolution and document 
size wisely:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Use 256 colors when working with animations that you later want to 
save in 3DO file format. Consider setting your Preferences to 8 bits per 
pixel if you work with 3DO animations frequently.<P> 
<LI>Don't work with a larger page size than you need. 
</UL>
<H2>Overview of creating animations with 3DO Animator</H2>
There are several ways to create animations using 3DO Animator: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Use 3DO Animator to create a flip-book animation.<P> 
<LI>Load a QuickTime movie file and make changes as desired, then save the 
file in 3DO file format.<P>
<LI>Use the Build an Animation command in the File menu to create an 
animation from a series of sequentially numbered PICT files. Make changes 
as needed, then save in 3DO format.<P>
<LI>Use the Quick Build 3DO Anim command in the 3DO Options menu to 
automatically concatenate 3DO cels in a specified folder (see page ).
</UL>
<H2>Special features for processing animations with 3DO Animator</H2>
3DO Animator offers several processing options that apply to all the 
frames of an animation: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Move or resize a selection in all frames of an animation by choosing 
Apply Selection to All Frames (Selection menu).<P>
<LI>Replace colors in all frames of an animation by choosing All Frames in 
the Replace Colors dialog available from the Colors menu.<P>
<LI>Trace part of a digitized movie and use the drawing as a separate 
document by using the light table (Animation menu). 
</UL>
