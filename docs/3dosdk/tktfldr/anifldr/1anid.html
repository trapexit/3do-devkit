A custom palette lets you work in a different color system, modify or name 
a color in the palette, reorganize the colors, or create a spread of 
colors in the palette.<P>

If you're not satisfied with the palette 3DO Animator generated for a 
document, you can modify the 3DO palette by changing one or more colors. 
You then have to update or remap the document before you save it.<P>
<H3>Selection in the 3DO palette</H3>
Before you can change colors in the 3DO palette, you have to understand 
its selection mechanism. The table below provides an overview of the 
things you can do:<P>

After modifying a palette, apply it to the document using the Remap 
Document button or the Update Document button. <P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Remap Document-</B>Updates the document, mapping each color to the 
closest one in the new palette. If the document is an animation, 3DO 
Animator remaps each frame. Remap Document always creates a new document, 
with the cel type as a suffix in the document name.<P>
<LI><B>Update Document-</B>Updates the document on the screen but does no 
remapping; that is, does not recompute each color unless the palette has 
fewer colors than before. 
</UL>
<H3>Example: Using Update Document or Remap Document</H3>
Update Document differs from Remap Document in the following ways: <P>
Assume you select a shade of yellow in the document and change it to a 
shade of purple. <P>
<UL>
<LI>If you choose Remap Document, all yellow pixels in the document will 
have a new index. The new index stays as close to yellow as possible 
within the range of the palette.<P>
<LI>If you choose Update Document, all the yellow pixels will become 
purple.
</UL>
<DL>
<DD><B>Note: </B>Use Update Document for an image or cel that uses 256 
colors. <BR>
</DL>
<A NAME="XREF38179"><H2>Saving and loading palettes</A></H2>
3DO Animator lets you save and load palettes, making it possible to use 
the same palette with more than one cel or image. Certain palette choices 
can be used to de-noise video frames or to enforce color schemes.<P>
<B>Note: </B>You should save and load palettes for coded cels in 3DO PLUT 
format.<P>
This section steps you through saving and loading a palette. <P>
<H3>Saving a palette</H3>
