Animated custom brushes let you use parts of an animation to create new 
animations. You can stamp a changing picture on the different frames of an 
animation, and create interesting effects by starting at different 
frames.<P>
This section first steps you through looking at an existing custom brush 
that changes its shape each time you paint with it. After that, you learn 
about creating an animation using the custom brush. <P>
