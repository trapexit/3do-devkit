<H1><LINK NAME="XREF31708">Extended intellec hex Format (IHF)</LINK></H1><HR>
This format is for small (&lt; 64KB) images, such as those destined for ROM. IHF is essentially a plain binary format, encoded as 32-bit hex values and checksummed. All the restrictions of plain binary format apply to the generation of IHF.<P>
