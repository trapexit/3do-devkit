<H1>About this document</H1>
The ARM Software Development Toolkit (the toolkit) is a suite of hardware independent development tools, libraries and support utilities, which allow development of applications based on the ARM family of RISC microprocessors. The following components of the toolkit are described in this manual:<P>

<LI><A HREF="./arr1frst.html#XREF37859">The ARM C Compiler</A>
<LI><A HREF="./arr2frst.html#XREF25147">ARM C Library Porting Guide</A>
<LI><A HREF="./arr3frst.html#XREF25184">The ARM Linker</A>
</UL>
This manual is intended as a reference guide for users of the ARM toolkit who require more detailed information than is represented in the User Manual.<P>
This manual is intended to be used in conjunction with the rest of the ARM toolkit documentation, and also with the ARM datasheet relevant to the specific device being used.<P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="./arr1frst.html#XREF37859">The ARM C Compiler</A> is a reference guide to the ARM C cross compiler, and includes all the information required to make effective use of the ARM C system. 
<p>
<LI><A HREF="./arr2frst.html#XREF25147">ARM C Library Porting Guide</A> discusses source organization, building a target-specific library, retargetting a library, and details of target-dependent code. 
<p>
<LI><A HREF="./arr3frst.html#XREF25184">The ARM Linker</A> provided detailed information about the ARM linker and its use.
