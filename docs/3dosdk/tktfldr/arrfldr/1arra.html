<H1><LINK NAME="XREF31195">About the ARM C compiler</LINK></H1><HR>
The ARM C compiler is a mature, industrial-strength compiler, based on Codemist Limited's multi-target, multi-language compiler suite (also known as the <I>NorCroft</I> C compiler). Derived compilers are used by, or distributed by, amongst others: <P>
<UL>
<LI>Advanced RISC Machines (for the ARM processor);
<LI>Acorn Computers (for their ARM-based personal workstations); 
<LI>INMOS (for the Transputer); 
<LI>Hitachi (internal use on IBM 370 compatibles); 
<LI>Perihelion Software (for their<I> </I><I>Helios</I> portable operating system).
</UL>
By default, the ARM C Compiler compiles ANSI C as defined by <I>American National Standard for Information Systems - Programming Language C</I>, X3J11/90-013, Feb 14, 1990.<P>
The compiler also has a <I>pcc</I> mode, which accepts the dialect of C used by Berkeley Unix. In this mode, the compiler has been used to build a complete ARM-based BSD Unix system (the RISCiX system, marketed by Acorn Computers Limited, which has also achieved X/Open branding).<P>
Pcc mode is selectable from the compiler's command line.<P>
In its ANSI mode, the ARM C compiler has been tested against release 2.00 of the Plum-Hall C Validation Suite (CVS), which is widely considered to be the toughest C test suite available, and has been adopted by the British Standards Institute for C compiler Validation in Europe. In the language conformance sections of the CVS, it fails in only two trivial ways, both failures to produce required diagnostics:<P>
<UL>
<LI>An empty initialiser for an aggregate of complete type is not 
diagnosed, e.g.<p>

    <CODE>
<PRE>
int x[3] = {};
</CODE>
</PRE>
<p>
<LI>Signed integer constant overflow is not diagnosed, but merely warned of, e.g.

    <CODE>
<PRE>
case INT_MAX+1: ...
</CODE>
</PRE>
</UL>
Wherever possible, the ARM C compiler adopts widely used command-line options which should be familiar to users of both Unix and DOS.<P>
