<TITLE>Linker pre-defined symbols </TITLE>
<H1><LINK NAME="XREF32914">Linker pre-defined symbols </LINK></H1><HR>
There are several symbols which the Linker defines independently of any of its input files. The most important of these start with the string <I>Image$$</I>. These<I> </I>symbols, along with all other external names containing <I>$$</I>, are reserved by ARM.<P>
The image-related symbols are:<P>

--------------------------------------------------------
Symbol               |Description                       
--------------------------------------------------------
Image$$RO$$Base      |The address of the start of the   
                     |read-only area (usually this      
                     |contains code).                   
--------------------------------------------------------
Image$$RO$$Limit     |The address of the byte beyond the
                     |end of the read-only area.        
--------------------------------------------------------
Image$$RW$$Base      |The address of the start of the   
                     |read/write area (usually this     
                     |contains data).                   
--------------------------------------------------------
Image$$RW$$Limit     |Address of the byte beyond the end
                     |of the read/write area.           
--------------------------------------------------------
Image$$ZI$$Base      |Address of the start of the       
                     |0-initialised area (zeroed at     
                     |image load or start-up time).     
--------------------------------------------------------
Image$$ZI$$Limit     |Address of the byte beyond the end
                     |of the zero-initialised area.

The object/area-related symbols are the following:<P>

Symbol               |Description                       
--------------------------------------------------------
areaname$$Base       |The address of the start of the   
                     |consolidated area called areaname.
--------------------------------------------------------
areaname$$Limit      |The address of the byte beyond the
                     |end of the consolidated area      
                     |called areaname.

<P>
Image$$RO$$Limit need not be the same as Image$$RW$$Base, although it often will be in simple cases of -AIF and -BIN output formats. Image$$RW$$Base is generally different from Image$$RO$$Limit if:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the -DATA option is used to set the image's data base (Image$$RW$$Base);
<p>
<LI>if either of the -SHL or -OVerlay options is used to create a shared library or overlaid image, respectively.
</UL>
It is poor programming practise to rely on Image$$RO$$Limit being the same as Image$$RW$$Base.<P>
Note that the read/write (data) area may contain code, as programs sometimes modify themselves (or better, generate code and execute it). Similarly, the read-only (code) area may contain read-only data, (for example string literals, floating-point constants, ANSI C const data).<P>
These symbols can be imported and used as relocatable addresses by assembly language programs, or referred to as <I>extern</I> addresses from C (using the -fC compiler option which allows dollars in identifiers). Image region bases and limits are often of use to programming language run-time systems.<P>
Other image formats (for example shared library format) have linker-defined symbolic values associated with them. These are documented in the relevant sections in this chapter, and in a separate documents in the Technical Specifications.<P>
