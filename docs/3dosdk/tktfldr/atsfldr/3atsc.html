<H1>Object code libraries </H1><HR>
An object code library is a library file whose members are files in ARM Object Format (see <A HREF="./ats2frst.html#XREF16187">ARM Object Format</A> for details).<P>
An object code library contains two additional chunks: an external symbol table chunk named OFL_SYMT; and a time stamp chunk named OFL_TIME.<P>
<H2>OFL_SYMT </H2>
The external symbol table contains an entry for each external symbol defined by members of the library, together with the index of the chunk containing the member defining that symbol.<P>
The OFL_SYMT chunk has exactly the same format as the LIB_DIRY chunk except that the Data section of each entry contains only a string, the name of an external symbol, and between 1 and 4 bytes of NUL padding, as follows:<P>

<P>
OFL_SYMT entries do not contain time stamps.<P>
<H2>OFL_TIME</H2>
The OFL_TIME chunk records when the OFL_SYMT chunk was last modified and has the same format as the LIB_TIME chunk (see <A HREF="./3atsb.html#XREF15659">Time stamps</A>). <P>
