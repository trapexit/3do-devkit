<H1><LINK NAME="XREF28151">ARM Procedure Call Standard</LINK></H1><HR>
The <I>ARM Procedure Call Standard</I> (<I>APCS</I>) is a set of rules which regulate and facilitate calls between separately compiled or assembled program fragments. The APCS defines:<P>
<UL>
<LI>constraints on the use of registers;
<p>
<LI>stack conventions;
<p>
<LI>the format of a stack-based data structure, used by stack tracing programs to reconstruct a sequence of outstanding calls;
<p>
<LI>the passing of machine-level arguments, and the return of machine-level results at externally visible function/procedure calls;
<p>
<LI>support for the ARM shared library mechanism; a standard way for shared (reentrant) code to address the static data of its clients, (See <A HREF="../arrfldr/arr3frst.html#XREF25184">The ARM Linker</A> for details).

Since the ARM CPU is used in a wide variety of systems, the APCS is not a single standard, but a consistent family of standards. See <A HREF="./4atsb.html#XREF35590">APCS variants</A>  for details of the variants in the family.  Implementors of run-time systems, operating systems, embedded control monitors, etc., must choose the variant(s) most appropriate to their requirements.<P>
Naturally, there can be no binary compatibility between program fragments which conform to different members of the APCS family. Those concerned with long-term binary compatibility must choose their options carefully.<P>
<I>function</I> is used to mean function, procedure or subroutine.<P>
<H2>Design criteria</H2>
Throughout its history, the APCS has compromised between fastest, smallest and easiest to use.<P>
The criteria we have considered to be important are:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Function call should be fast and it should be easy for compilers to optimise function entry sequences.
<p>
<LI>The function call sequence should be as compact as possible.
<p>
<LI>Extensible stacks and multiple stacks should be accommodated.
<p>
<LI>The standard should encourage the production of reentrant code, with writable data separated from code.
<p>
<LI>The standard should be simple enough to be used by assembly language     programmers, and should support simple approaches to link editing, debugging and run-time error diagnosis.
</UL>
Overall, we have tended to rank compact code and a clear definition most highly, with simplicity and ease of use ahead of performance in matters of fine detail where the impact on performance is small.<P>
