<H1><LINK NAME="XREF27985">The Variables window</LINK></H1><HR>
The Variables window displays user-selected variables and current values. 
<P>
A Variables window is most useful for examining variables or data 
structures or for dereferencing pointers. It is also capable of parsing 
C-style expressions. <P>

<H2>Using multiple Variables windows</H2>
You can open Variables windows as needed. Each window has a number as part 
of the window name. At any given time, only one Variables window receives 
data. You can select that window by choosing Receive Data in its Options 
menu. The system automatically turns off all other Variables windows. <P>
When you send a variable from another window to the Variables window, the 
window receiving data comes to the front. <P>
<B>Note: </B>If there is only one Variables window, it is always the 
window that receives variable data.<P>
<H2>Working with Variables windows</H2>
In <A HREF="dbg1frst.html#XREF37307">3DO Debugger Quick Start</A> you are stepped through a small 
example of using the Variables window. The following table describes all major 
operations you can perform in the Variables window.<P>

--------------------------------------------------------
To...          |Do this...                              
--------------------------------------------------------
Open a window  |Press Command-M or select Variables from
               |the View menu.                          
--------------------------------------------------------
Add a variable |* Enter the variable you want to display
or other       |into the text edit field at the top of  
expression to  |the window. Any standard C expression is
the display    |allowed.                                
               |* Press Return or click the Evaluate    
               |button.                                 
               |This enters the selection into the      
               |window and displays the current value.  
--------------------------------------------------------
Examine a      |Select a variable in any window by      
variable from  |double-clicking on it, then press       
any window     |Command-Shift-M to examine that variable
               |in the Variables window.                
--------------------------------------------------------
Delete a       |* Click on the variable you want to     
variable       |delete.The variable name is displayed in
               |the text field at the top of the window 
               |and the Clear button is enabled.        
               |* Click on the Clear button or press the
               |Clear key on the Macintosh keyboard (you
               |may need to do this twice if the        
               |variable is not editable).              
--------------------------------------------------------
Change variable|* Click on the variable.The variable    
values         |name is displayed in the text field at  
interactively  |the top of the window. When you select  
               |the variable, its current value is      
               |displayed in the Value field.           
               |* Type the new value into the Value     
               |field and press Return or Enter to      
               |change the value.                       
               |Note: You cannot edit constant values,  
               |expressions, or the base of a C         
               |structure. In that case, Not Editable is
               |displayed in the Current Value field.   
--------------------------------------------------------
Dereference a  |Commanddouble-click on the pointer. A   
pointer        |new line representing the dereferenced  
               |pointer is added to the variables list. 
               |If the field cannot be dereferenced, you
               |hear an alert sound.                    
--------------------------------------------------------
Select a window|Choose Receive Data from the Options    
for receiving  |menu of the desired Variables window. To
data           |compare the values of variables at      
               |different states in the program, you can
               |create several Variables windows and    
               |select a different one for receiving    
               |data at any state that's of importance.

<H2>Variables window options</H2>
The Variables window Options menu lets you determine how data is displayed 
in the Variables window. <P>

<H3>Auto Update</H3>
Automatically refreshes the window during stepping operations or when the 
program executing on the target hits a breakpoint. This slows the general 
operation of the Debugger, but provides a more current and accurate 
display.<P>
<H3>Receive Data</H3>
If you choose Send Variable Data to work with an expression, the Debugger 
directs it to the Variables window for which Receive Data is selected. 
Selecting Receive Data in a window deselects it in any other window. <P>
<H3>Decimal / Hex / char / C string / Pascal string</H3>
Allows you to select the format of the displayed variable. If the field 
cannot be displayed in the selected format, nothing happens. If a C string 
is longer than 256 characters, it is truncated to about 250 characters. <P>
<H3>Frac16-16 / UFrac16-16 / Frac12-20 / UFrac12-20 </H3>
Select one of these options to display fixed point numbers or their 
unsigned counterparts. The number is displayed as <CODE>int.frac</CODE>. 
For example, Frac16 x = 0x00018000 is displayed as 1.5. <P>
You can also enter a new value using this format. No conversion is 
performed if you use no decimal point. For example, if you type 1.0, the 
new value is 0x00010000, but if you type 1, the new value is 
0x00000001.Frac16 numbers-which use the Frac16 type defined by the 
operating system-are automatically displayed in Frac16-16 format. <P>
