<H3>Synopsis </H3>
<CODE>lmadm -acdmtuvyz dev_name unit offset mount_dir</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Performs administrative tasks on a Linked Memory filesystems. lmadm is 
designed to perform a variety of tasks. It checks and repairs (-c), 
defragments (-d), mounts (-m),unmounts (-u), and auto-maintains (-a) the 
filesystem.<P>
<H3>Options</H3>
<DL>
<DT>-a
<DD>Auto-maintains the filesystem: Unmounts the filesystem, 
checks/repairs, defragments, and remounts the filesystem. In case of a 
failure in the consistency check/repair or defragmentation process, the 
filesystem is formatted. This option is used mainly at system startup. 
This option is mutually exclusive with all other options except for -v and 
-y. This option implies -y.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>-c
<DD> Consistency check and repair. Consistency check is performed in 
multiple passes and all repairs are reported. This option is mutually 
exclusive with -a, -m, and -u.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> -d
<DD>Defragments the filesystem. As a result of adding and deleting files, 
filesystems become fragmented and free extents become scattered. The 
defragmentation process gathers all scattered free extents and combines 
them into a single contiguous extent. This process not only improves 
system performance, but it also enables the filesystem to succeed in 
allocating storage for larger files. This option is mutually exclusive 
with -a, -m, and -u.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>-m
<DD>Mounts the filesystem. It only mounts the filesystem on the specified 
device, if the filesystem is not already mounted. This option is mutually 
exclusive with all other options except -v and -y.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>-t
<DD>Displays output on the TV monitor as well.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>-u
<DD>Unmounts the filesystem. It only unmounts the filesystem, if the 
filesystem is mounted. This option is mutually exclusive with all other 
options except -v and -y. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>-v
<DD>Signifies verbose.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>-y
<DD>Performs all major/minor repairs needed to bring the filesystem to a 
consistent state.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>-z
<DD>Removes all zero-sized files. This is performed during the 
defragmentation process, therefore it is to be used in conjunction with 
the -a or -d options. 
</DL>
<H3>Arguments</H3>
<DL>
<DT>dev_name
<DD>Name of the device on which the filesystem resides.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>unit
<DD>Device unit number.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>offset
<DD>Offset within the device where the filesystem   resides.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT>mount_dir
<DD>Name of the directory on which the filesystem is mounted. 
</DL>
<H3>Examples</H3>
The following line maintains the nvram filesystem for operation, this is 
mainly invoked at system startup:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
$boot/system/Programs/lmadm -a ram 3 0 nvram
</CODE>
</PRE>
The following line performs consistency check and an automatic repair:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
$c/lmadm -cy ram 3 0 nvram 
</CODE>
</PRE>
The following line verbosely performs a defragmentation process on the 
nvram filesystem:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
$c/lmadm -dv ram 3 0 nvram 
</CODE>
</PRE>
The following line mounts the nvram filesystem<P>
<CODE>$c/lmadm -m ram 3 0 nvram</CODE><P>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
Don't run the defragmentation process unless you have a clean 
filesystem.<P>
Always check/repair the filesystem first, before the defragmentation 
process is started. If you use both -d and -c, the filesystem is first 
checked and repaired and then defragmented. The result of defragmenting a 
corrupted filesystem is unpredictable. If you use -a, and the check/repair 
process fails, the filesystem is automatically formatted. All existing 
data on the filesystem is cleared. <P>
