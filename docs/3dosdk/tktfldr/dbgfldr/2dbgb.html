<H1><LINK NAME="XREF23497">Display windows</LINK></H1><HR>
The 3DO Debugger offers three types of display windows:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Source windows for examining source code
<LI>Disassembly windows for examining and editing opcodes
<LI>Data windows for examining and editing memory
</UL>
To create a new display window and display the selection in the active 
window in it, hold down the Shift key while using the View menu command or 
keyboard shortcut.<P>
Instead of creating a new window, you can also change the display from one 
type of data to another using the display window pop-up menu).<P>

<B>Note: </B>If you change the window type, all option settings are lost. 
You may prefer creating a new window to changing the window type if you 
spent some time on window setup. <P>
<A NAME="XREF42047"><H2>The Source window</A></H2>
The Source window displays the source code associated with the current 
program. It allows source stepping and highlights the source line that 
represents the current PC. You can type one of the expressions listed in 
<A HREF="./Adbg.html#XREF20176">Examine Field Expression Syntax</A> into 
the Examine field of the Source window. <P>
<B>Note: </B>You can only examine source code if you have used a makefile 
that created a symbols file and if you have set up directories 
appropriately, as discussed in the section <A 
HREF="./1dbgb.html#XREF33691">Preparing for launch</A>.<P>

               |execute.The system sets a temporary     
               |breakpoint at the location you chose,   
               |executes up to that breakpoint, then    
               |removes the breakpoint. If there are    
               |intermediate breakpoints, the program   
               |stops there first. None of the program  
               |instructions are executed, so this is a 
               |convenient way of skipping over program

<A NAME="XREF38594"><H2>Using conditional breakpoints from the Source 
window</A></H2>
If you want to stop your program only when certain conditions are met, you 
can set (or edit) a conditional breakpoint. For example, you can set a 
counter and break after a certain number of iterations through the loop, 
or you can specify to break when a certain variable has a certain value.<P>
You can set and edit conditional breakpoints in both the Source window and 
the Disassembly window.<P>
<H3>Setting a conditional breakpoint</H3>
To set a conditional breakpoint, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>In the BreakPoints window, select a breakpoint and click on the 
Condition button.
<p>
<LI>Enter the condition in the Condition window (see Figure 3).
<p>
<LI>Use the trigger count to specify how many times the Debugger can hit 
the breakpoint without stopping execution. 1 means stop at the first 
occurrence and is the default. 
<p>
<p><B>Note: </B>Having several conditional breakpoints can severely slow 
down your program. Use them with discretion.<BR>
<p>

<P>
<B>Figure 3: </B><I>Breakpoint Condition window. </I><P>
</OL>
<H3>Editing the condition for a conditional breakpoint</H3>
To edit the condition for a conditional breakpoint, follow these steps: <P>
<OL>
<LI>Double-click on the breakpoint in the BreakPoints window or 
Command-click on the bullet in the Source or Disassembly window to bring 
up the Condition window. 
<p>
<LI>Edit the condition, reset the current count, or disable the breakpoint 
by unchecking the Enabled box. 
</OL>
When a breakpoint is disabled, it no longer has a bullet () next to it in 
the BreakPoints window. In the Source and Disassembly windows, the 
breakpoint indicator bullet changes to a blue triangle.<P>
A disabled breakpoint no longer interrupts the program.<P>
<H3>Deleting a conditional breakpoint</H3>
You can delete a conditional breakpoint like any other breakpoint by 
clicking on the breakpoint symbol.<P>
<A NAME="XREF36381"><H2>The Data window</A></H2>
Data windows let you display and edit target machine memory as bytes, 
half-words (16 bits), and words (32 bits). The data can be presented in 
hexadecimal, decimal, ASCII, or binary format.<P>
This section first provides an overview of all operations, then lists the 
Data window Options menu commands. <P>
