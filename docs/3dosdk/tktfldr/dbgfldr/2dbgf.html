The Stack window displays the current contents of the stack. Optionally, it lets you view the Svc, User, FIRQ, IRQ, Abort, or Undefined stacks in byte, half-word (16-bit), or word (32-bit) format. The current value of the current stack pointer is marked by a down arrow (<B>&gt;</B>) to the right of the associated address. <P>
