Separates AIF file from symbols file.<P>

<H3>Description</H3>
<CODE>Stripaif</CODE> is an MPW tool that must be run after armlink. 
<CODE>Stripaif</CODE> takes a standard AIF file and generates two new 
files:<P>
<UL>
<LI>a smaller AIF file with no symbolic information 
<LI>a file with only the symbolic information (extension <I>.sym</I>)
</UL>
You only need to download the small application file to the 3DO Station. 
The Debugger is capable of using an external symbols file: If an 
application needs to be debugged and the AIF file does not include 
symbolic information, the Debugger looks for a symbol file with the name 
of the application and the extension <I>.sym</I>. <P>
When you compile and link a program, all symbolic information generated by 
the armcc, armasm, and armlink tools is saved in the ARM Image File (AIF), 
along with the application code. As applications grow, this results in 
oversized application files that, when launched, require more time and 
more memory on the 3DO Station than necessary. To avoid that, you would 
need a link option that separates symbols from actual code, generating two 
files instead of one. Since this option is not currently available, the 
Debugger provides a <CODE>stripaif</CODE> tool that gives similar 
results.<P>
