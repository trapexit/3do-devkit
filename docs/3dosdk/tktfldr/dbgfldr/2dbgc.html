The following paradigms are used through all display windows and the Variables window:<P>
<UL>
<LI>To select a field or word in any display window, double-click it. 
<p>
<LI>To examine a selection, Command-double-click on it. This is especially useful in the Variables window where you can, for example, examine a structure by double-clicking on it.
<p>
<LI>To examine a selection in a new window of a different type, hold down the Shift key while you use the key sequence to open a window of that type while the item is selected. For example, to view an item in a Variables window, press Command-Shift-M.
