<H3> Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>lmdf [-k]</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
lmdf displays the amount of disk space occupied on nvram, the amount of 
used and available space, and how much of the filesystem's total capacity 
has been used and fragmented. lmdf produces an output similar to the 
following: <P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
Device Bytes used avail capacity fragment Mounted on ram.3.0 32768 
16408 16040       50%       27%  /nvram
</CODE>
</PRE>
Note: used+avail is less than the amount of space in the filesystem 
(Bytes|Kbytes); this is due to filesystem overhead. Furthermore, the 
amount of space available in the filesystem cannot be allocated all to a 
single file due to fragmentation.   <P>
If the filesystem is fragmented, use lmadm to defragment the filesystem. 
However, if there is no fragmentation (fragment reports 0%), then the 
available space in its entirety can be allocated to a single file.<P>
If nvram is not mounted, no data are reported. <P>
