<P>
<B>Note: </B>You can place hard-coded breakpoints into the source code if you include debug.h in that file. Putting a Debugger()<I>;</I> statement anywhere in the code will then cause a breakpoint. Use Ignore Software Breakpoints in the Preferences dialog if you want to run your program without stopping at these breakpoints.<P>
