Stresses the IO subsystem to uncover bugs.<P>
<H3>Synopsis</H3>
<CODE>iostress [-quit]</CODE><P>
<H3>Description</H3>
Installs a set of monitoring routines that catch incorrect use of the IO 
subsystem.<P>
The monitoring routines ensure the following:<P>
<UL>
<LI>When writing data, the routines guarantee that the buffer used for the 
IO remains consistent and does not get altered while the write operation 
occurs. This guarantees that a title is not manipulating data that are 
being fetched by an IO module.
<LI> When reading data, the routines guarantee that it is not possible to 
read any data associated with the IO request until the IO request has been 
completed. This guarantees that a title is not reading data before it has 
been completely transferred.
<LI>The monitoring routines do their work by allocating temporary buffers 
and using these for the IO transactions. Doing so requires some extra 
memory, and requires some extra CPU time to copy data between the buffers. 
This can affect the performance of a title, possibly causing some jerky 
animations, but should never cause a crash, or trashed sound or graphics. 
If these things happen, then the title has a bug.
<H3>Arguments </H3>
</UL>
<DL>
<DT>-quit
<DD>Tells a previously started version of iostress to exit. 
</DL>
<H3>Implementation </H3>
Command implemented in V24. <P>
$c/iostress<P>
<H3>Caveats</H3>
Quitting is a tricky operation and does not always work. The safest way to 
"quit" is to reset the system.<P>
