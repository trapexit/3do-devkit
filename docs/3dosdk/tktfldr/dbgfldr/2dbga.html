--------------------------------------------------------
Command       |Description                              
--------------------------------------------------------
Current       |Displays the current Source Directory    
Source...     |pathway. To modify the current source    
              |directory, use Directories &gt; Setup.      
--------------------------------------------------------
Current       |Displays the current Data Directory      
Data...       |pathway. To modify the current data      
              |directory, use Directories &gt; Setup.      
--------------------------------------------------------
Setup...      |Presents a standard Macintosh directory  
              |selection dialog, which allows you to    
              |select the directory where source and    
              |data files are found. Set the source     
              |directory to the folder location of the  
              |source file, the data directory to the   
              |location of the .sym file.               
--------------------------------------------------------
</PRE>
<P>
<B>Note: </B>You can also set source directories using a .spt script file. 
See  <A HREF="./1dbgb.html#XREF26436">Using an spt script file to set 
source directories</A> for more information.<P>
<H3>Save Config</H3>
Saves the current window positions and settings as part of the preferences 
file.<P>
<H3>Save Config As...</H3>
Saves the current window positions and settings as a separate file. <P>
<H3>Load Config...</H3>
Opens a file previously created with the Save Config As command. The file 
specifies window positions and settings. <P>
<H3>Start CD Access Log...</H3>
Causes the Debugger to start collecting information about CD-ROM access in 
a log file. You are prompted for the location of the file. CD access is 
performed by a number of functions in the filesystem folio. If you are 
working with a version of the system that does not have a CD-ROM attached, 
CD-ROM access is simulated. You can use this command to determine how much 
of a program's time is spent retrieving data from the CD-ROM.<P>
<H3>Page Setup...</H3>
Displays the standard Macintosh Page Setup dialog for changing page size, 
orientation, and other defaults for printing 3DO Debugger windows.<P>
<H3>Print...</H3>
Prints the active window.<P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-P<P>
<H3>Special Mode</H3>
When you select this mode, the Debugger no longer goes through the main 
event loop and gives high priority to file I/O. As a result, your program 
runs much faster than in normal mode. When you select Special Mode, a 
dialog informs you that you can click the mouse button or press any key to 
return to normal mode. <P>
<H3>Loop On...</H3>
Allows looping on a script, useful when preparing a standalone 
demonstration program. If you select Loop On, you are prompted for a file, 
which has to be a shell script or a 3DO application. The file is executed 
in the foreground repeatedly until you click the mouse button or press a 
key. At that time, the current cycle is executed to completion but no new 
cycle is started. <P>
<H3>No Target Check</H3>
Select this item to temporarily disconnect the Macintosh from the 3DO 
Station. The Macintosh will ignore any incoming message or I/O request 
from the 3DO Station. To resume normal communication, uncheck the item. 
You shouldn't have to use this feature during a normal debugging session. 
<P>
<H3>Acquire</H3>
This command is always disabled. <P>
<H3>Release &amp; Quit</H3>
Releases the 3DO Station by executing a Go command, then quits the 
application. For more information on the Go command, see <A 
HREF="#XREF34460">The Execution menu</A>.<P>
<H3>Quit</H3>
Quits the application and returns to the Finder.<P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-Q<P>
<A NAME="XREF28625"><H2>The Edit menu</A></H2>
The Edit menu lets you edit text, clear the active Variables window, and 
display the Preferences dialog boxes.<P>

window. Otherwise, clears the entire Terminal window.<P>
<H3>Select All</H3>
Selects all text in the Terminal window if it is the active window. <P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-A<P>
<H3>Fonts... </H3>
Changes fonts in the active Data and Terminal windows. This command is 
dimmed if it does not affect the active window. <P>
<H3>Preferences... </H3>
Displays a dialog box for selecting preferences and downloading flash ROM. 
This dialog box is discussed in <A 
HREF="./2dbgi.html#XREF25825">Preferences and Configuration dialog 
box</A>.<P>
<A NAME="XREF36145"><H2>The View menu</A></H2>
The View menu opens 3DO Debugger windows or brings them to the front if 
they are open already. The Debugger displays a list of all Variables 
windows it creates during one session at the bottom of the menu. You can 
make a Variables window active by selecting it in that list. You can also 
send a selected variable from the active Source window to the Variables 
window that receives data for display.<P>

<H3>New Window</H3>
Opens a new Disassembly, Data, or Source window. <P>
If you hold down the Shift key while opening a new display window, the 
selection in the active window is used as the base address for the new 
window.<P>
Keyboard shortcuts: <P>
Command-J (DisAsm)
Command-B (Data)
Command-K (Source)<P>
<H3>Variables </H3>
Opens a new Variables window. To bring an already open one to the front, 
select it from the list of open display windows at the bottom of the View 
menu. <P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-M<P>
<H3>Registers </H3>
Opens (or brings to the front) the ARM CPU Registers window. <P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-R<P>

program.<P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-Y<P>
<H3>BreakPoints</H3>
Opens (or brings to the front) the BreakPoints window.  <P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-U<P>
<H3>Terminal </H3>
Opens (or brings to the front) the Terminal window.  <P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-T<P>
<H3>Clock</H3>
Opens the Target Clock window, which displays the current ticks of the 
program running on the 3DO Station in hexadecimal and microseconds. <P>
<H3>Send Variable Data</H3>
Allows you to send a variable selected in the Source window to the 
Variable window that receives data. <P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-D<P>
<H3>(Open Display Windows)</H3>
Lists all openVariables windows at their examined addresses. Select one to 
bring it to the front.<P>
<A NAME="XREF34460"><H2>The Execution menu</A></H2>
The Execution menu controls the execution of the program running on the 
3DO Station.<P>

<IMG SRC="Figures/002.Ch2Pics/Executionmenu.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be 
displayed">
<P>
<B>Figure 4: </B><I>Execution menu. </I><P>
<H3>Go</H3>
Starts execution at the current value of the program counter (PC). If 
you've just launched the Debugger, use this command to release the 
operating system.<P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-G<P>
<H3>Stop</H3>
Stops the current task on the 3DO Station but not the operating system. If 
the current task was not your program but a system task, you may need to 
try again.<P>
If you know the program well, a better way to stop it is to display a 
Source or Disassembly window and set a breakpoint on an instruction likely 
to be executed. The program will then stop at the break. <P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-. (Command-Period)<P>
<H3>HW Reset...</H3>
Prompts whether you want to reset the target hardware. If you confirm, 
resets and relaunches the target when you press Command-G.<P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-H<P>
<H3>Trace</H3>
Provides a menu which has a submenu of available trace options:<P>
<UL>
<LI>In-Traces into subroutines and functions. Keyboard shortcut: Command-I
<LI>Over-Traces across subroutines and functions. Keyboard shortcut: 
Command-O
</UL>
<H3>Step Over</H3>
Executes one instruction at the current value of the program counter (PC), 
stepping over subroutines and function calls. If a Source window is active 
(with the Examine field set to PC), one source line will be executed; 
otherwise, one opcode will be executed. (See Note below.)<P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-, (Command-Comma)<P>
<H3>Step In</H3>
Executes one instruction at the current value of the program counter (PC), 
stepping into subroutines and function calls but stepping over system 
calls. By default, one opcode is executed. If a Source window is active, 
one source line is executed. (See Note below.)<P>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-; (Command-Semicolon)<P>
<B>Note: </B>Sometimes, the 3DO Debugger does not step and requests that a 
Source window be set to PC. If that happens, create a new Source window 
(Command-K) and try again. If you always keep one Source window set to PC, 
this condition will never occur. <P>
<H3>Kill Aborted Task</H3>
If a task causes an abort, the Debugger takes control. You then have two 
choices: Make an appropriate change, for example, change a variable, and 
then continue execution, or kill the task that caused the abort using the 
Kill Aborted Task command. This allows you to execute a new task without 
performing a Hardware Reset.<P>
<H3>Execute</H3>
Prompts you for a program to execute. Using this command is similar to 
typing the program's name into the Terminal window, but sets up 
directories appropriately in addition to executing the program. <P>
<A NAME="XREF15988"><H2>The Target menu</A></H2>
The Target menu controls launching, downloading, and dumping the program 
running on the 3DO Station and to access the performance analyzer. <P>

<B>Figure 5: </B><I>Target menu. </I><P>
<H3>Launch... </H3>
Displays a dialog box for selecting a script to execute. <P>
<UL>
<LI>Execute Current (or pressing Return) selects the named script. 
<LI>Execute lets you specify a new script.
<LI>Cancel (or pressing the Escape or Command key) lets you use the 
Debugger without a script. This allows you to examine memory, but not much 
else. 
</UL>
Keyboard shortcut: Command-L<P>

<P>
<B>Figure 6: </B><I>Launch dialog box.</I><P>
<H3>Download... </H3>
Presents a standard Macintosh file selection dialog box for downloading 
binary files to the 3DO Station.<P>
<H3>Memory Dump... </H3>
Displays a dialog box that lets you dump target RAM as a binary image 
file. Enter the start and end addresses, then select Dump to create the 
output binary file.<P>

<H3>Performance Analyzer... </H3>
Displays the Performance Analyzer dialog box, which lets you monitor the 
percentage of execution time spent in different routines.<P>

<IMG SRC="Figures/002.Ch2Pics/PerfAnalyzer.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be

<P>
<B>Figure 8: </B><I>Performance analyzer dialog box. </I><P>
Click Start Sampling to begin collecting samples; click Stop Sampling to 
pause the sampling process. Click Stop &amp; Quit to stop the sampling 
process. Output goes to a text file called <I>3DODebug.Perf</I>. The 
performance analyzer reports:<P>
<UL>
<LI>how much time is spent in execution of the user task and how much time 
is spent on system tasks and other overhead
<p>
<LI>how much time is spent in the different functions in the user task 
</UL>
You can get both hierarchical and nonhierarchical samples in the report. A 
hierarchical sample provides all calling functions for each function that 
is called. <P>
<B>Note: </B>Since the performance analyzer itself affects the performance 
of the system, you only get a rough estimate of the actual performance 
when you use it. <P>
<H3>Redirect Terminal</H3>
Writes a copy of all terminal output to a file you specify. <P>
<P>
