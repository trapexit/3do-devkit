3DO Development Station. To play a movie, it must be located in the 
<I>remote</I> folder.<P>

<LI>First copy  EZQPlayer and your movie stream (after the Weaver has run) 
to your <I>remote</I> folder
<p>

<LI>Launch EZQPlayer from the Debugger.  It takes one argument, the name 
of the movie stream, e.g., <CODE>ezqplayer copter.stream</CODE>. In this 
case, this is a stream created by running MovieToEZQPlayer and then 
running the weaver.
