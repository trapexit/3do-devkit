<TITLE>Preparing source material</TITLE>
<H1>Preparing source material</H1><HR>
Video capture and compression are time-consuming, so prepare source 
material carefully. Typical source materials include:<P>
<UL>
<LI>your own video 
<LI>film- or video-based material from video tape or laser disc
<LI>computer animations 
</UL>
Keep in mind that storage becomes an issue as soon as you get into the 
digital world. Each second of video takes about 5 minutes of processing 
time and requires 30 MB when digitized. Don't expect to capture first and 
edit later; instead, edit your beta tapes as far as possible before 
compressing them. Try to digitize only the material you need-but use the 
highest quality possible. <P>
<H2>Securing a master copy</H2>
Make a copy of your source material to use as a "working master," and for 
dubbing working copies. Store the original in a safe place. Remember that  
during capture each segment of the video is played multiple times, which 
can result in degradation of the quality. <P>
<H2>Shooting your own video</H2>
Plan your shoot or select your video carefully. Advice on producing 
materials that compress well is provided in the section "Will It Compress 
Well?" later in the chapter. The following tips apply to shooting your own 
video:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Determine the final frame rate before shooting so you can shoot at a 
lower frame rate, thus decreasing the disk space you'll need. 
<p>
<LI>Reuse a single segment, if possible. For example, tile 10-second 
pieces of moving water for longer stretches.
<p>
<LI>Use high-quality equipment, such as Betacam SP.
<p>
<LI>Be prepared to deal with interlace effects in moving from analog 
(double-buffered) to digital video. You can deinterlace using linear 
interpolation with edge following, as discussed below. 
</UL>
<H2>Preparing film source material</H2>
Many videos started out as film; using video derived from film requires 
special consideration, because the Telecine process inserts composite 
frames into the video. Also, eliminate as much 
noise as possible to minimize problems during compression. <P>
<H3>Understanding the Telecine process</H3>
When producing video from film source material, studios use the Telecine 
process to transfer the source material from celluloid to magnetic tape, 
and from 24 fps to 30 fps. Telecine conversion is explained in detail in 
Chapter 5, "Video Tools," in the section "The 3-2 Pulldown tool."<P>
<H2>Will it compress well? </H2>
When preparing source material, keep in mind certain factors that can 
affect how well or how badly the material compresses. <P>
<H3>Eliminating noise</H3>
Most films have noticeable film grain noise and  scratches. To the 
compression tool this noise is significant, and is maintained or even 
emphasized during compression. Therefore, you should remove as much of it 
as possible before compression. Below are several options for reducing 
film grain noise:<P>
<UL>
<LI>A post-production studio can clean up analog film. 
<p>
<LI>If your source is film, reduce grain noise using a median or recursive 
noise filter, which picks out sharp anomalies like spots or pops. 
<p>
<LI>On D1, D2, or D3 video, a digital filter can be used right after the 
Telecine process. 
<p>
<LI>Low-light shoots generate more film or video noise. Three CCD 
(couple-charged device) cameras generate less video noise. 
</UL>
<H3>Edge crawl</H3>
Jagged edges cause edge crawl on TV monitors. Edge crawl can be caused by 
uneven resizing or aliasing, so always use anti-aliasing resizing. <P>
<H3>Other considerations</H3>
Bear in mind that:<P>
<UL>
<LI>A source with constant backgrounds and solid colors yields the best 
results. 
<LI>Slow color gradients cause color banding when compressed with Cinepak. 
<LI>Slow pans/zooms are difficult to compress well. 
</UL>
