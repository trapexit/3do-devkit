This chapter provides an an overview of video preparation for a 3DO title. 
Keep in mind that the source data in video processing is raw, uncompressed 
video, film, or film converted to video, probably at 640 x 480 pixel 
resolution. The goal of video processing is to produce a cropped, resized, 
compressed movie that is ready for data streaming.<P>
 Below is a list of the  major steps in the process, and the corresponding
