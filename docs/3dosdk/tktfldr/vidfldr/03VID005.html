If you want to change the frame size of your movie, remember that cropping is cheap and easy and resizing is very time consuming. Note that you can create interesting effects using less than full-screen video, incorporated in your title at a smaller size. For example, splitting the screen into different panels and showing video in only one of them can result in considerable space savings. <P>

You can resize in Photoshop, DeBabelizer, or CoSA After Effects. DeBabelizer and After Effects resize QuickTime movies best.<P>
Generally, resize by a factor of 50 percent to blur diagonal lines and reduce edge crawl. This means reducing 640 x 480 to 320 x 240, and 576 x 432 to 288 x 216. <P>
