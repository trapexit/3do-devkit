MovieCompress compresses movies using any of the Apple QuickTime codecs. 
It lets you specify frame rate, key frame rate, data rate, depth, and 
codec. This section provides a table of relevant information for each option 
available during compression. A tutorial-style example follows. <P>
<H3>Compression algorithm</H3>
The compression algorithm pop-up lets you choose how your source will be 
compressed.<P>

Description     |Works well at all pixel depths. It     
                |stores images in run-length encoding   
                |format and works in lossy or lossless  
                |mode.

Sources         |content.                               
--------------------------------------------------------
Quality         |Performance depends on the type of     
                |image in a scene. Clean images         
                |generated synthetically generally yield
                |good results.Images captured from      
                |videotape may be problematic if there  
                |is visual noise.

Description     |Lossy algorithm that takes much longer 
                |to compress than to decompress.Can     
                |constrain data rates to user-definable 
                |levels. This is important when         
                |compressing material for playback from 
                |CD-ROM discs.

Quality         |Higher compression rates, better image 
                |quality and faster playback speeds than

Hints & Tips    |For best results, use on raw source

Description     |Generates an image one-half the size of
                |the same image compressed with         
                |Animation compressor. Good alternative 
                |to Animation compressor if compression 
                |ratio is more important than           
                |decompression speed.                   
--------------------------------------------------------
Recommended     |8-bit still images and image sequences 
Sources         |if compression ratio is more important 
                |than decompression speed.              
--------------------------------------------------------
Hints &amp; Tips|Use this compressor with relatively    
                |slow storage devices such as CD-ROM    
                |discs. In that case, the Graphics      
                |compressor has enough time to          
                |decompress the image or image sequence.

<H3>Color Quality Selection</H3>
The Color Quality Selection pop-up differs depending on the compression 
algorithm you choose. Use it to choose between color and grayscale or to 
select the color depth to be used. <P>
<H3>Compression quality</H3>
The Quality slider lets you choose between high-quality slow compression 
and low-quality fast compression. <P>
<H3>Frames per second</H3>
The<I> </I>Frames per second pop-up lets you select a frame rate. You can 
also type in the desired frame rate. Whatever your source frame rate 
setting is, your destination rate remains the same. That is, if your 
source is at 30 fps, your destination is also 30 fps.<P>
<B>Note: </B>For smooth displays, pick a frame rate that's divisible by 
two, because you must eliminate every other frame to end up with smooth 
transitions between frames. For example, if the original rate was 24, pick 
12; if the original rate was 30, pick 15. <P>
<H3>Key frame settings</H3>
The Key frame settings option lets you specify how many key frames should 
be preserved during compression. Choose a high number if there's a lot of 
motion in the movie, a lower rate if not. <P>
<H3>Data rate limitation </H3>
This section lets you specify at what data rate the compressed movie will 
be played.<P>

<H3>How to compress a movie</H3>
To compress a movie, follow these steps:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Drag your source movie on top of the MovieCompress icon. 
<p>
<p>The Compression Settings dialog appears. 
<p>

<IMG SRC="Figures/VID5.figs/VID.Settings.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be

<P>
<B>Figure 1: </B><I>Compression Settings dialog.</I><P>

<LI>From compression algorithm pop-up- set to Video by default- choose 
Cinepak. 
<p>
<LI>Select color. 
<p>
<LI>Leave the Quality slider at normal. 
<p>
<LI>In the Motion section, leave Frames per second at Best (the default 
setting). 
<p>
<p>If you choose Best, MovieCompress keeps the original movie's number of 
frames per second. 
<p>

<LI>Set key frame every 24 frames. 
<p>
<LI>Limit the data rate to 210 K/second. 
<p>
<p>This leaves 90 K/Second for the stereo audio track. 
<p>

<LI>Click OK and a second dialog appears, prompting you for a destination 
file.
<p>
<LI>Specify the destination file and you're done.
<p>
<p>A progress dialog is visible as compression takes place.
