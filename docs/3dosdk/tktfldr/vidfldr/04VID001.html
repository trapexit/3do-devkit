This chapter discusses Cinepak compression, which permits full-frame, full-motion capture for the 3DO Station.  Cinepak compression is referred to as Compact Video in Macintosh documentation.<P>
The <I>Pioneers</I> folder of Toolkit 1.5 also includes the Beta version of EZ Squeeze, a 3DO video compression and playback engine that lets you create and play back compressed digital video in software only. For information on EZ Squeeze, including codecs, see <A HREF="./06VID001.html#XREF33417">EZ Squeeze</A>.<P>

The Apple QuickTime tool, ConvertToMovie, is included on the QuickTime 1.5 CD-ROM. ConvertToMovie is available through AppleLink and Internet FTP access (the IP address is ftp.apple.com).<P>
The Cinepak conversion tool, MovieToStream, is included in the <I>Streaming</I> folder on the 3DO Toolkit 1.5 CD.<P>
<H2>Quality issues</H2>
While Cinepak compression may result in artifacts, its advantage is that it's software only. You can currently get Cinepak compression using MovieCompress, ConvertToMovie, or COSA. All three are reliable and robust applications to use in Cinepak compression.<P>
