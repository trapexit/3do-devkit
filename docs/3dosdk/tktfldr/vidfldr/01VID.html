summarizes major steps in video preparation and indicates appropriate 
chapters. A flowchart of the process is included.
<p>
<LI><A HREF="./02VID001.html#XREF30012">Selecting Hardware</A> discusses 
possible hardware combinations and costs.
<p>
<LI><A HREF="./03VID001.html#XREF23639">Capturing and Processing 
Materials</A> explains how to prepare materials for capture, how to 
capture them, and how to process them in preparation for compression.

<p>
<LI><A HREF="./05VID001.html#XREF37240">Video Tools</A> covers the video 
processing tools provided or supported by 3DO. These include: 
<p>
<UL>
<LI>The 3-2 Pulldown tool for processing video that was originally based 
on film. 
<p>
<LI>MovieCompress for compressing movies using Apple QuickTime codecs. 
MovieCompress lets you specify frame rate, key frame rate, data rate, 
<p>
<LI>Quality, depth, and codec. It also offers a drag-and-drop feature for 
opening a movie file, and is AppleScript-scriptable for the four standard 
events (Open, OpenDoc, Quit, Save).
<p>
<LI>ConvertToMovie, a third-party tool with functionality similar to that 
of MovieCompress.
<p>
<LI>MovieEdit, which lets you play and edit QuickTime movies. Dynamic 
displays of time code, time unit, and frame number information give users 
greater flexibility and precision in editing movies. 
<p>
<LI>MovieProcess and MovieProcess PPC (both in the Pioneers folder of this 
release), which deinterlaces to 20 frames per second (fps), offers 
variable save options for archiving during different stages of processing, 
and is scriptable with AppleScript for the four standard events (Open, 
OpenDoc, Quit, Save).
