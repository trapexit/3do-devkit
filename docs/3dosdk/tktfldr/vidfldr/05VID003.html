<TITLE>The 3-2 Pulldown tool</TITLE>
<H1>The 3-2 Pulldown tool</H1><HR>
The 3-2 Pulldown tool removes composite frames from a QuickTime movie. 
This increases the movie's perceived resolution, while reducing the 
bandwidth required to display it on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer. <P>
Only movies that start as film and are converted to analog video need 3-2 
Pulldown processing. If you're not sure whether a movie was originally 
captured on video, follow the steps in "Identifying Composite Frames" 
later in this chapter to check for the composite frames present in movies 
converted from film to video.<P>
<H2>Understanding Telecine</H2>
Composite frames are intermediate frames inserted into a movie during 
Telecine conversion from film to video. This process converts film that 
displays at 24 frames per second into video tape that displays at 30 
frames per second. Each set of four film frames is converted into 
interlaced video fields and then the video fields are reconstructed into 
five video frames as shown in the figure below.<P>
The third and fourth video frames in this figure are composite frames that 
replace the second film frame. With these two composite frames included, 
the movie can be displayed at the 30 fps rate required by most analog 
video standards.<P>
When analog video is converted into a QuickTime movie, however, these 
composite frames are included. Since the human eye often does not 
distinguish the difference between 24 fps and 30, you can remove the 
composite frames from your movie and display it at 24 fps in your 3DO 
application. This results in a clearer picture since the composite frames 
are not true digitized versions of corresponding film frames.<P>

<H2>Choosing a movie</H2>
Currently, 3-2 Pulldown processes only QuickTime movies that meet the 
following criteria:<P>
<UL>
<LI>30 frames per second
<LI>raw format (no compression)
</UL>
You can check the frame rate of a movie and find out whether it's been 
compressed with a number of QuickTime tools. Apples's MovieAnalyzer tool 
includes the frame rate and compression codec in the information window it 
displays for each video track in a movie.<P>
<B><B>Note: </B> </B>3-2 Pulldown requires raw source data. Make sure your 
movie has not been compressed with JPEG before you process it with 3-2 
Pulldown.<P>
<H2>Field dominance</H2>
To process a QuickTime movie correctly, you need to determine its field 
dominance. The field dominance setting determines whether a video capture 
system (video tape deck, laser disk recorder, etc.) selects an even or odd 
interlace field as the first field it uses when creating the first frame 
of a movie. Below are the field dominance selections for two standard 
video capture systems:<P>
<PRE>
-----------------------------------------------------
System               |Field Dominance                
-----------------------------------------------------
Pioneer LaserRecorder|Even                           
-----------------------------------------------------
Sony Betacam         |Odd                            
-----------------------------------------------------
</PRE>
<P>
Choose Preferences in the File menu to display the 3-2 Pulldown 
preferences dialog. Select either Even or Odd, depending on the field 
dominance of your movie. If you do not know what system was used to 
capture it, choose Odd (the most common field dominance) and then check 
for a field dominance error when saving the processed movie. See 
"Incorrect Field Dominance" under "Troubleshooting" to learn how to check 
for field dominance errors.<P>
<H2>Removing composite frames</H2>
To process a movie:<P>
<UL>
<LI>mark the composite frames
<LI>check the frame markers
<LI>save the movie
</UL>
When you open 3-2 Pulldown, the standard File dialog appears. Select the 
movie you want to process and click Open. The movie displays in a standard 
movie player window. You can step forward or backward by clicking on the 
frame-advance icons in the lower-right corner of the display or by using 
the left and right arrow keys.<P>
<H3>Identifying composite frames</H3>
As you step through the movie, two out of every five frames should be 
composites. Since the composite frames are created from interlace fields 
from two different film frames, you can identify them by the misalignment 
or "aliasing" of the interlace fields. Below is an example of a sequence 
of frames.<P>

<IMG SRC="Figures/VID5.figs/VID.ComposFrames.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be 
displayed">
<P>
<B>Figure 2: </B><I>Composite frames show misaligned fields.</I><P>
When you identify a pair of composite frames, mark the first one by 
choosing Mark from the Frame menu. Doing this  identifies the composite 
frame as the first in a pair that will be converted into a reconstructed 
frame by 3-2 Pulldown. <P>
A status bar under the movie window shows the time, frame, and phase 
numbers for the frame displayed.  3-2 Pulldown updates the status bar as 
you step through the movie. The green rectangle in the status bar 
represents a mark for that frame.<P>
The phase counter represents the five-frame sequence of true and 
composited frames that 3-2 Pulldown expects. If the sequence of composite 
frames goes out of phase, return to the last correctly marked set of 
composite frames and review the movie again until you can identify and 
mark the next set of composite frames.<P>
<H3>Identifying composite frame sequences in edited film</H3>
With film that has been edited after Telecine processing, there can be 
three composite frames in sequence. This usually occurs when two sets of 
composite frames are combined during editing of a video tape. Of the three 
composite frames, two should form one reconstructed frame and one remains 
as an "orphan" frame.<P>

<IMG SRC="Figures/VID5.figs/VID.ReconstrFrames.gif" ALT="Graphic cannot be

<P>
<B>Figure 3: </B><I>Correctly and incorrectly marked composite 
frames.</I><P>
The figure above shows the results of marking two different frames. In 
this sequence frames 1 and 2 are the correct set of composite frames. 
Marking frame 1 results in a true reconstructed frame. Marking frame 2 
results in a reconstructed frame that remains aliased.<P>
<H3>Marking a movie</H3>
It may take several passes through a movie to mark all the composite 
frames correctly. Because edits may change the sequence of composite 
frames, you cannot assume that marking the first set of composite frames 
synchronizes the reconstruction process for the remainder of the movie. To 
speed up the review process, use the tab key to step through the marked 
frames.<P>
<H2>Saving a processed movie</H2>
Choose Save as Pulldown from the File menu to save the movie. When 3-2 
Pulldown saves, it displays the reconstructed frames as they are created. 
Check each reconstructed frame for the interlace field aliasing that 
indicates an incorrectly reconstructed frame. You may need to reset the 
frame markers and save the movie again.<P>
Uncompressed QuickTime movies take up large amounts of disk space. 
Processing to remove composited frames requires enough disk space to store 
both the unprocessed and processed versions of the movie. Removing 
composited frames-that is, one out of every five-reduces the size of the 
unprocessed movie by approximately 20 percent and cuts the required disk 
space accordingly. <P>
It is possible that a processed movie will contain fewer composited frames 
if it's edited after Telecine processing, resulting in a final file size 
greater than 80 percent of the number of pre-Telecine frames. The 
processed movie will never be larger than the unprocessed movie, 
however.<P>
<H2>Troubleshooting</H2>
<P>
Some common problems that arise with video processing and their solutions are listed below.
<H3>Synchronizing audio</H3>
A processed movie should contain 80 percent of the number of frames as the 
unprocessed movie. For example, a 900-frame movie should contain 720 
frames after 3-2 Pulldown processing. If an unprocessed film contains more 
than the normal number of composite frames as a result of post-Telecine 
editing, the processed film may not contain the expected number of total 
frames. This can put the movie's audio track out of sync with the video 
track, and you may have to paste frames back into the video track to 
restore video and audio synchronization.<P>
<H3>Incorrect field dominance</H3>
If you've chosen the wrong field dominance, the reconstructed frames 
created by 3-2 Pulldown will not be correctly interlaced. Instead of the 
interlace fields matching correctly, they will be aliased to a greater 
degree than they were in the corresponding composite frames. To remedy 
this, change the field dominance in the Preferences dialog and save the 
movie again. <P>
