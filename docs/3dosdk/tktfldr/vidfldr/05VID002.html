With MovieEdit you can play and edit QuickTime movies. MovieEdit lets you 
cut, copy, and paste at all stages of processing, except after 
compression, when it becomes impossible to identify the key frames. 
Dynamic information about time code, time units, and frame number allows 
more precise editing than some other tools. <P>
You can also change the duration of any number of frames (from one to all) 
in a movie. To do this, choose <I>Change duration</I> from the <I>Editt</I> 
menu and in the dialog that appears, enter a new duration in QuickTime 
time units.<P>
<B>Note: </B>Increasing a movie's time duration causes the movie play bar 
slider to extend beyond the boundary of the play bar by the amount of 
increased duration. When this occurs the movie does not play to the last 
frame, but begins to loop from the part that extends past the play bar 
boundary to the second to last frame of the entire clip.<P>
Figure 1 shows an example of a MovieEdit window. Note the time code, 
QuickTime time units, and frame number information displayed in Figure 1.

<H2>Saving movies with MovieEdit</H2>
MovieEdit lets you save movies in three different formats accessible 
through the Save As menu:<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Dependent movie</B>-stores references to the movie resources. The 
original movie data files must be on the same Macintosh as the dependent 
movie file. This option saves smaller files than the original.
<p>
<LI><B>Self-contained movie</B>-stores the movie resources as well as the 
movie data. This movie does not need the original movie to be played. 
Saves larger files than dependent movie.
<p>
<LI><B>Cross-platform movie</B>-stores a self-contained, single-fork 
movie. This movie can be played on other OS platforms, for example SGI 
(UNIX) or PC (DOS) machines.

<P>
<H2>Limitations</H2>
The tool currently has the following limitations: <P>
<UL>
<LI>The maximum number of movies that you can open simultaneously is 20.
<p>
<LI>If the application memory size is not large enough, the movie is not 
displayed. Increase the minimum memory requirement of MovieEdit to display 
it. 
<p>
<LI>MovieEdit currently does not update the dynamic time information while 
playing a movie. 
</UL>
<H3>Tricks of the Trade</H3>
If you cut/copy and paste pieces of a movie, be sure to do so at frame 
boundaries. If you use the slider to move to the end or beginning of the 
sequence you want to cut or copy, you should then step one frame forward 
(or backward) to be sure you're at a frame boundary. <P>
