The ARM Assembler compiles ARM Assembly Language into object code in ARM Object Format. This is then suitable for linking by the ARM Linker, with (or without) other object code produced by either the ARM Assembler or ARM C Compiler, or with object libraries.<P>

For more information about ARM Assembly Language see and <A HREF="../acbfldr/acb2frst.html#XREF32584">Exploring ARM Assembly Language</A>. For more information about different formats the ARM Linker can produce see <A HREF="./aug3frst.html#XREF21025">The ARM Linker (armlink)</A>. <P>
In this chapter, and in other documentation which refers to <I>armasm</I>, the first and second pass are mentioned. <I>armasm</I> processes its source files twice to reduce the amount of internal state which needs to be kept-this effects the user in a few ways which are mentioned below, and in <A HREF="./aug7frst.html#XREF15616">ARM Assembly Language</A>.<P>
