The conditional looping statement, useful for generating repetitive tables, is provided in the assembler by the WHILE...WEND directives. This produces an assembly-time loop, not a run-time loop. Because the test for the WHILE condition is made at the top of the loop, it is possible that no code will be generated during assembly; lines are listed as for conditional assembly. The syntax is:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
WHILE
</CODE>
</PRE>
<CODE>
<PRE>
...code...
WEND
</CODE>
</PRE>
