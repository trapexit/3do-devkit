This document covers the following topics:<P>
<UL>
<LI>The components of the ARM Software Development Toolkit;
<LI>A brief overview of each of the ARM software tools and how to invoke them;
<LI>An introduction to the runtime libraries;
<LI>ARM assembly language;
</UL>
This manual is intended to be used in conjunction with the other ARM toolkit documentation included in this release. Examples of how to use the tools, and many issues which arise when using them are not covered in this manual, but in <A HREF="../acbfldr/0acbfrst.html#XREF40578">The ARM Cookbook</A>.<P>
Detailed technical explanations of the tools and the underlying specifications behind them are also not covered in this manual-see the <A HREF="../arrfldr/0arrfrst.html#XREF21713">ARM Reference Manual</A> and <A HREF="../atsfldr/0atsfrst.html#XREF33752">ARM Technical Specifications</A> respectively.<P>
It is likely to be useful to have a copy of the ARM Datasheet for whatever device is being used, as the manuals do not cover device specific issues.<P>
