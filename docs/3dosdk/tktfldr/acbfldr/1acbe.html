<LI>Why loading constants / addresses is an issue on the ARM;

<LI>How to solve it using ADR and ADRL
</UL>
<H2>Why is loading constants an issue?</H2>
Since all ARM instructions are precisely 32 bits long, and ARM 
instructions do not use the instruction stream as data, there is no single 
instruction which will load any 32 bit immediate constant into a register 
without performing a data load from memory.<P>
However, there are ways to load many commonly used constants into a 
register without resorting to a data load from memory.  Of course, a data 
load from memory allows any 32-bit value to be loaded into a register, but 
the added expense of a data load can often be avoided.<P>
The assembler provides several 'instruction extensions', and two pseudo 
instructions to make the efficient loading of constants and addresses 
non-painful.<P>
<A NAME="XREF35172"><H2>MOV / MVN</A></H2>
As described in the recipe <A HREF="./1acbc.html#XREF32971">Using the 
Barrel Shifter</A>, the MOV and MVN instructions allow many constants to 
be constructed.  The constants which these instructions can construct must 
be eight bit constants rotated right through an even number of positions.  
By using MVN the bitwise complement of such values can also be 
constructed.<P>
Having to convert a constant into this form is an onerous task no-one 
wants to do.  Therefore <B>armasm</B> will do this automatically.  Either 
MOV or MVN may be used with a constant which can be constructed using 
either of these instructions.  <B>armasm</B> will choose the correct 
instruction and construct the constant.  If it is impossible to construct 
the desired constant <B>armasm</B> will report this as an error.<P>
To illustrate this, look at the following MOV and MVN instructions.  The 
instruction listed in the comment is the ARM instruction which is produced 
by <B>armasm</B>.<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
MOV R0, #0                                 ; =&gt; MOV R0, #0
MOV R1, #&amp;FF000000                         ; =&gt; MOV R1, #&amp;FF, 8 
MOV R2, #&amp;FFFFFFFF                         ; =&gt; MVN R2, #0
MVN R0, #1                                 ; =&gt; MVN R0, #1
MOV R1, #&amp;FC000003                         ; =&gt; MOV R1, #&amp;FF, 6
MOV R2, #&amp;03FFFFFC                         ; =&gt; MVN R2, #&amp;FF, 6
MOV R3, #&amp;55555555                         ; Reports an error--cannot 
be constructed
</CODE>
</PRE>
<H2>Assembling the example</H2>
The above code is available in <B>loadcon1.s</B> in the <B>examples</B> 
directory.  To assemble it first set the current directory to 
<B>examples</B> and then issue the command:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
armasm loadcon1.s -o loadcon1.o -li
</CODE>
</PRE>
To confirm that <B>armasm</B> produced the correct code, the code area can 
be disassembled by looking at the output from:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
decaof -c loadcon1.o
</CODE>
</PRE>
<H3>Explanation</H3>
The -li argument can be omitted if the tools have been configured 
appropriately. <P>
<B>decaof</B> is the ARM Object Format decoder.  The -c option requests 
that decaof dissassemble the code area.<P>
<A NAME="XREF17845"><H2>LDR Rd, =numeric constant</A></H2>
<B>armasm</B> provides a mechanism which unlike MOV and MVN can construct 
any 32-bit numeric constant, but which may not result in a data processing 
operation to do it.  This is the "LDR Rd, =" mechanism.<P>
If the numeric constant can be constructed by using either MOV or MVN, 
then this will be the instruction used to load the constant.  If this 
cannot be done, however, <B>armasm</B> will produce an LDR instruction to 
read the constant from a literal pool.<P>
<H2>Literal pools</H2>
A literal pool is a portion of memory set aside for constants.  By default 
a literal pool is placed right at the end of the program.  However, for 
large programs, this literal pool may not be accessible throughout the 
program (due to the LDR offset being a 12 bit value), so further literal 
pools can be placed using the LTORG directive.<P>
When the "LDR, Rd, =" mechanism needs to access a literal in a literal 
pool, <B>armasm</B> first checks previously encountered literal pools to 
see if the desired constant is already available and addressable.  If it 
is then this literal is addressed, otherwise <B>armasm</B> will attempt to 
place the literal in the next available literal pool.  If this literal 
pool is not addressable then an error will result, and an additional LTORG 
should be placed close to  (but after) the failed "LDR Rd,=" 
instruction.<P>
Although this may sound somewhat complicated, in practice, it is simple to 
use.  Consider the following example, which demonstrates how literal pools 
and "LDR Rd,=" work.  The instruction listed in the comment is the ARM 
instruction which gets produced by <B>armasm</B>.<P>

  LDR R2, =&amp;FFFFFFFF           ; =&gt; MVN R2, #0

  LTORG                        ; Literal Pool 1 contains literal &amp;55555555

  LDR R3, =&amp;55555555           ; =&gt; LDR R3, [PC, #offset to Literal Pool 1]
; LDR R4, =&amp;66666666           ; If this is uncommented it fails, Literal
                               ; Pool 2 is not accessible (out of reach)

<H3>Explanation</H3>
The -li argument can be omitted if the tools have been configured 
appropriately. <P>
<B>decaof</B> is the ARM Object Format decoder.  The -c option requests 
that decaof dissassemble the code area.<P>
<H2>LDR Rd, =PC relative expression</H2>
As well as numeric constants, the "LDR Rd, =" mechanism can cope with PC 
relative expressions, such as labels.<P>
Even if a PC relative ADD or SUB could be constructed, an LDR will be 
generated to load the PC relative expression.  Thus if a PC relative ADD 
or SUB is desired then ADR should be used instead (see <A 
HREF="#XREF22093">ADR and ADRL</A>).  If no suitable literal is already 
available, then the literal placed into the next literal pool will be the 
offset into the AREA, and an AREA relative relocation directive will be 
added to ensure that the constant is appropriate wherever the containing 
AREA gets located by the linker.  See <A 
HREF="../arrfldr/3arre.html#XREF31016">The handling of relocation 
directives</A> for more information about relocation directives.<P>
As an example consider the code below.  The instruction listed in the 
comment is the ARM instruction which gets produced by <B>armasm</B>.<P>

<A NAME="XREF22093"><H2>ADR and ADRL</A></H2>
Sometimes it is important for efficiency purposes that loading an address 
does not perform a memory access.  The assembler provides two pseudo 
instructions which make it easier to do this.<P>
Whereas MOV and MVN only accept numeric constants, ADR and ADRL accept 
numeric constants, PC relative expressions (labels within the same area) 
and register relative expressions.<P>
ADR will attempt to produce a single data processing instruction to load 
an address into a register.  This instruction will be one of MOV, MVN, ADD 
or SUB, in the same way as the "LDR Rd, =" mechanism produces 
instructions. If the desired address cannot be constructed in a single 
instruction an error will be produced.<P>
ADRL will attempt to produce either two data processing instructions to 
load an address into a register.  Even if it is possible to produce a 
single data processing instruction to load the address into the register 
then a second, redundant instruction will be produced (this is a 
consequence of the strict two-pass nature of <B>armasm</B>) .  In cases 
where it is not possible to construct the address using two data 
processing instructions ADRL will produce an error - the LDR, = mechanism 
is probably the best option in this case.<P>
As an example consider the code below.  The instructions listed in the 
comments are the ARM instruction which are produced by <B>armasm</B>.<P>
