<H2>About this recipe</H2>
This recipe describes a 32-bit pseudo random number generator implemented 
efficiently in ARM Assembly Language.<P>
<H2>The details</H2>
It is often necessary to generate pseudo random numbers, and the most 
efficient algorithms are based on shift generators with exclusive-or 
feedback (rather like a cyclic redundancy check generator).  Unfortunately 
the sequence of a 32-bit generator needs more than one feedback tap to be 
maximal length (ie. 2^32-1 cycles before repetition), so this example uses 
a 33 bit register with taps at bits 33 and 20.<P>
The basic algorithm is newbit:=bit33 EOR bit20, shift left the 33 bit 
number and put in newbit at the bottom;  this operation is performed for 
all the newbits needed (ie. 32 bits).  The entire operation can be coded 
compactly by making maximal use of the ARM's barrel shifter:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
; enter with seed in R0 (32 bits), R1 (1 bit in least significant bit)
; R2 is used as a temporary register.
; on exit the new seed is in R0 and R1 as before
; Note that a seed of 0 will always produce a new seed of 0.
; All other values produce a maximal length sequence.
;
    TST    R1, R1, LSR #1                       ; top bit into Carry
    MOVS   R2, R0, RRX                          ; 33 bit rotate right
    ADC    R1, R1, R1                           ; carry into lsb of R1
    EOR    R2, R2, R0, LSL #12                  ; (involved!)
    EOR    R0, R2, R2, LSR #20                  ; (similarly involved!)

<H2>Using this example</H2>
This random number generation code is provided as <I>random.s</I> in the 
<I>examples</I> directory.  It is provided as ARM Assembly Language source 
which can be assembled and then linked with C modules (see recipes in  <A 
HREF="./acb3frst.html#XREF41444">Interfacing Assembly Language and C</A> 
for more information).<P>
The C test program <I>randtest.c</I> (also in the <I>examples</I> 
directory) can be used to demonstrate this.  First set the <I>examples</I> 
directory to be your current directory, and execute the following commands 
to build an executable suitable for <I>armsd</I>:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
armasm random.s -o random.o -li
armcc -c randtest.c -li -apcs 3/32bit
armlink randtest.o random.o -o randtest 
</CODE>
</PRE>
Where <I>somewhere</I> is the path to the <I>lib</I> directory of the ARM 
Software Development Toolkit release.<P>
Note that in both the above commands, and the <I>armsd</I> command below, 
<I>-li</I> indicates that the target ARM is little endian, and <I>-apcs 
3/32bit</I> specifies that the 32 bit variant of the ARM Procedure Call 
Standard should be used.  These options can be omitted if the tools have 
already been configured appropriately.<P>
<I>armsd</I> can be used to run this program as follows:<P>
<CODE>
