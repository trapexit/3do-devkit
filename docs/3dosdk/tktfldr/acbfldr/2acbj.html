<H2>About this recipe</H2>
This recipe gives a compact ARM Instruction Sequence to perform byte order 
reversal ie. reversing the endianess of a word.<P>
<H2>The details</H2>
Changing the endianess of a word can be a common operation in certain 
applications.  For example when communicating word sized data as a stream 
of bytes to a receiver of the opposite endianess.<P>
This operation can be performed efficiently on the ARM, using just four 
instructions.  The word to be reversed is held in a1 both on entry and 
exit of this instruction sequence.  ip is used as a temporary register 
(For more information about these register names see <A 
HREF="./acb3frst.html#XREF41444">Interfacing Assembly Language and C</A>):

    EOR    ip, a1, a1, ror #16
    BIC    ip, ip, #&amp;ff0000
    MOV    a1, a1, ror #8
    EOR    a1, a1, ip, lsr #8

A demonstration program which should help explain how this works has been 
provided in source form in the <I>examples</I> directory.  To compile this 
program and run it under <I>armsd</I> first set your current directory to 
be <I>examples</I> and then use the following commands:<P>

Note that this program uses ANSI control codes, so should work on most 
terminal types under Unix and also on the PC.<P>
