This document covers a broad spectrum of topics; from introductory 
illustrations through to complex examples. The material has not been 
grouped or ordered by complexity, but by theme. Where possible, we have 
given real recipes, supported by on-line code explained and available for 
you to adapt to your particular needs. <P>
To get the most out of the recipes, use this manual in conjunction with 
the on-line examples, as well as the rest of the toolkit documentation. 
The user is sometimes referred to other parts of the documentation for 
more information.<P>
It is also useful to have a copy of the ARM Datasheet for whatever device 
is being used, as these manuals do not cover device specific details.<P>
<H1>Audience</H1>
This manual is aimed at competent programmers who want to find out rapidly 
how to exploit the ARM instruction set and make use of the ARM Software
