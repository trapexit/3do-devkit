<H2>About this recipe</H2>
This recipe gives you a simple exercise in using the ARM Software 
Development Toolkit (the toolkit) to write a program in C. By following 
it, you will learn how to:<P>
<UL>
<LI>use the ARM C compiler <B>armcc</B> to create a runnable program;
<LI>use the ARM source level debugger <B>armsd</B> to run your program on 
a (simulated) ARM system;
<LI>use <B>armcc</B> to compile a C program to an object file;
<LI>use the ARM linker <B>armlink</B> to create a runnable program from an 
object file and the ARM C library.
</UL>
<H2>Prerequisites</H2>
Before you can try this recipe, the toolkit must be properly installed on 
your computer. Instructions for installation are given in the installation 
notes distributed with every toolkit. If you experience any difficulties, 
please refer to these notes.<P>
<H2>Making a simple runnable program</H2>
The "Hello World" program shown below, is included in the on-line examples 
as file <B>hellow.c</B> in the directory <B>examples</B>:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main( int argc, char **argv )
{ 
    printf("Hello World\n");
      return 0;
}
</CODE>
</PRE>
If you set your working directory to be the <B>examples</B> directory you 
can compile this program to runnable form in a single step using:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
armcc hellow.c -li -apcs 3/32bit
</CODE>
</PRE>
<H3>Explanation</H3>
The argument -li says that the target is little endian and -apcs 3/32bit 
says that the 32 bit ARM procedure call standard should be used. If the 
compiler has been <B>configured</B> to use these options by default then 
these arguments need not be given.  The executable program is left in a 
file called <B>hellow</B>.<P>
<H2>Running the program</H2>
You can run the program (technically an AIF Image) using <B>armsd</B>. You 
should follow the sample dialog below:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
host-prompt&gt; <B>armsd -li hellow</B>
A.R.M. Source-level Debugger, version 4.10 (A.R.M.) [Aug 26 1992]
ARMulator V1.20, 512 Kb RAM, MMU present, Demon 1.01, FPE, Little 
endian.
Object program file hellow
armsd: <B>go</B>
Hello world
Program terminated normally at PC = 0x000082a0
      0x000082a0: 0xef000011 .... : &gt;  swi     0x11
armsd: <B>quit</B>
Quitting
host-prompt&gt;
</CODE>
</PRE>
<H3>Explanation</H3>
The -li argument to <B>armsd</B> tells it to emulate a little endian arm. 
If armsd has been configured to be little endian by default then -li can 
be omitted .<P>
When armsd comes up with its "armsd:" prompt and waits for your command, 
you should type "go<B>CR</B>". At the next prompt type "quit<B>CR</B>" to 
exit <B>armsd</B>.<P>
<H2>Separate compiling</H2>
You can invoke the compiler and the linker separately. You can use:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
armcc -c hellow.c -li -apcs 3/32bit
</CODE>
</PRE>
to make an object file (in this example called <B>hellow.o</B>, by 
default).<P>
<H3>Explanation</H3>
The -c flag tells the compiler to make an object file but not to link it 
with the C library.<P>
<H2>Separate linking</H2>
When you have finished compiling, you can link your object file with the C 
library to make a runnable program using:<P>
<CODE>
<PRE>
armlink -o hellow hellow.o <B>somewhere</B>/armlib.321
</CODE>
</PRE>
Where we have written <B>somewhere</B>, above, you must type the name of 
the directory containing the ARM C libraries.<P>
<H3>Notes</H3>
You now have to be very explicit; you must specify:<P>
<UL>
<LI>the name of the file which will contain the runnable program (here, 
<B>hellow</B>);
<LI>the name of the object file (here, <B>hellow.o</B>);
<LI>the location and name of the C library you wish to use.
</UL>
In simple cases, <B>armcc</B> can reduce the need to be so explicit.<P>
