<H2>Useful Tips</H2>
To speed your way through the online documentation, you can do the following:<P>

<li>Use the home and end keys on your Macintosh keyboard to jump to the top or bottom of a page.
<P>
<li>For long pages, use the page up and page down keys instead of the scroll bar and mouse to read through a page.
<P>
<li>If you don't need or want to see the online graphics, you can turn them off in the Options menu. In Mosaic and Netscape, turn off <b>Auto-Load Images</b> in the <b>Options</b> menu. This will significantly increase loading time if you are reading the files off of the CD.
<P>
<li>Use the back arrow button to quickly revisit a previously viewed page without having to search for a hypertext link. 
<P>
<li>Use the forward arrow button to quickly return to a page.
If you get lost in the documentation, use the <b>Open Local... </b>or <b>Open File...</b> command in the <b>File</b> menu and return to this Welcome.html page.
