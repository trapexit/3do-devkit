 *
 *	History:
 *	1/20/94		rdg		make C++ compatible
 *	11/23/93	jb		Added CloseDataAcq() to allow deallocation of context block
 *						pool for cleanup processing.
 *	11/8/93		jb		Added TIME_BASED_BRANCHING
 *	8/19/93		jb		Took FAKE_ABORT_IO out. Kept the internal abortQueue
 *						structure in the context block, and added two new compile
 *						switches to control whether I/O is actually cancelled and
 *						whether or not the thread must wait for I/O completions
 *						before exiting. See the code aroung REALLY_ABORT_IO_ON_FLUSH and
 *						WAIT_FOR_IO_COMPLETION_BEFORE_EXIT.
 *	5/20/93		jb		Added queuing mechanism to permit a fixed number of IOReq items
 *						to be used no matter how many data buffers may exist. See
 *						changes demarked by ALLOW_REQUEST_OVERLOADING conditional.
 *	5/20/93		jb		Get rid of 'bufferList' as an input parameter. Data acquisition
 *						threads now internally own and track their own resources instead
 *						of storing any part of them (permanently) in a data request message.
 *	5/19/93		jb		Add FAKE_ABORT_IO hack.
 *	5/10/93		jb		Add 'fEOFWasSent' flag to AcqContext record. This gets set the
 *						first time we detect a request to read past EOF. We won't
 *						send another EOF until we see a "go marker" request. Instead,
 *						we reply with "was flushed" for further attempts to read
 *						past the EOF.
 *	5/9/93		jb		Add 'deltaPriority' param to NewDataAcq() to allow its caller
 *						to specify a delta priority for creating the data acquisition
 *						thread. The value is added to the calling task's priority, so
 *						a signed value can raise or lower the thread's relative priority.
 *	5/9/93		jb		Removed 'ResetDataAcq()' routine. All buffer flushing is now
 *						controlled only within the data acquisition thread when positioning
 *						takes place.
 *	4/19/93		jb		Add fields to context to support synchronous communications
 *						with our creator at the time of creation (so that
 *						a proper completion status can be given to the creator).
 *	4/17/93		jb		Substantial overhaul to accomodate New()/Dispose() model of
 *						creating and destroying data acquisition contexts.
 *	4/5/93		jb		New today.
